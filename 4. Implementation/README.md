#### IST-691 Deep Learning in Practice (in progress)

In this project we explored a breadth of topics including Deep Learning Fundamentals, the intricacies of Backpropagation, Optimization techniques, the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks, and advanced topics such as Transfer Learning and Autoencoding. This project features the deployment of various deep learning models, each meticulously tailored and fine-tuned, to architect an innovative stock portfolio system. This system is designed to not only compile a strategic selection of stocks but also to incorporate a sophisticated trading algorithm capable of autonomously rebalancing the portfolio in response to market dynamics. This practical implementation underscores the program's commitment to fostering a hands-on understanding of how deep learning can be leveraged to navigate and potentially capitalize on the complexities of financial markets.
