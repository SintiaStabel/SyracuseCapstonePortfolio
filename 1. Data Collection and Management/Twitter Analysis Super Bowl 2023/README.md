#### IST-652 Scripting for Data Science 

Here I explored various methods for managing, analyzing, and transforming both structured and unstructured data by scraping Twitter messages, saving them in MongoDB, and using Python's Pandas library to convert the raw JSON into a structured format. This project also includes an experiment in sentiment analysis, assessing if tweets about Super Bowl 2023 could predict the game's outcome. I collected 4,000 tweets using specific queries and analyzed them for sentiment using the TextBlob Python library. The analysis, presented in WordCloud visualizations, revealed no clear preference for a game winner, with positive sentiments outweighing negative ones. This project demonstrated my proficiency in data collection, management, and analysis, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of data science applications.
