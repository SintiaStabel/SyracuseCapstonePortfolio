#### IST - 659 Data Administration Concepts and Database Management

These files contain a sample database demostrating mastery in relational databases and SQL. In the course IST - 659, I gained deep knowledge in SQL querying, including advanced topics like nested queries and data transformation.  A key practical application of this learning was demonstrated in a group project where the author's team created a database from scratch for a fictional vineyard, "Chateau Cuse." This project involved designing a comprehensive database to manage the vineyard's production, sales, and human resources, allowing business analysts to efficiently analyze various aspects of the vineyard's operations. This experience not only solidified my understanding of database management but also highlighted its practical applications in real-world scenarios.
