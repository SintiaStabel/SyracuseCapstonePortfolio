Active, relentless defender with disruptive wingspan and good lateral quickness … Shows solid instincts and anticipation and gets blocks and steals without gambling … Versatile defender … Can switch onto 1-5 as a solid on ball defender on the perimeter and also holds his own in the post … Shows good feel as a help defender as well … Averaging 1.5 steals per game and around a block per game … Plays with a high level of energy at all times … Intelligent decision maker … Really seems to have a solid understanding of the game and plays with a lot of poise and maturity for a freshman … Also gives a high level of consistency with his effort and focus … Quality free-throw shooter (80% FT) , which is encouraging for continued success as a shooter at all three levels … Long strides and a quick first step allows him to get by most similar sized defenders with ease and gets to the rim in a flash … Good cutter who finishes lobs and layups around the basket with high efficiency … Elite athlete who can ignite a crowd and offense with flashy, powerful dunks in transition … Protects the ball with only 1.8 turnovers per game despite high usage rate (27%) … Stays out of foul trouble even with his aggressive, energetic, physical defensive style … Well-rounded two-way forward with great size and length combined with high degree of potential … Has the versatility/mobility to play as a small forward in big lineups, but appears best suited for the 4 position with his ability to create mismatches and rebound … Ability to defend the perimeter at his size is an added dimension missing from the other top bigs at the top of this draft … Emerging as potentially the top prospect in the top-heavy 2022 class as perhaps the safest floor combined with an intriguing ceiling …","Rebounding numbers could stand some improvement (6.2 per game), granted he’s playing away from the rim at times and has an elite bigman that he is sharing the front court with (Walker Kessler) … Added strength will allow him to play more physical around the rim … Average ball-handler who struggles to get to the basket on his own … If he can improve as an ISO guy it will open up his outside game further …. Decent passer but could improve in this department as well … Often settles for perimeter jumpers or lower percentage mid-range jumpers because of his reluctance/inability to get to the basket and create for others in the half-court offense … Still a small sample size offensively, but the physical traits are there to sustain efficient success with his jumper … Doesn’t create a ton of space for himself when he catches entry passes at the elbow. Usually settles for mid-range jumpers upon these entries … When he does drive, it is almost exclusively to his right as his drives to his left often end in turnaround jumpers … Needs to become a better ball-handler in order to improve upon these weaknesses …",11.2,0.037,-1.1,TBD
61,"A 6’8 225 frontcourt player with the frame, length, and mobility to play minutes all along the frontcourt in the NBA, especially as he fills out his frame … Agile; moves well laterally and has pretty decent leaping skills too, gets off the floor quickly off one or 2 feet … A smooth frontcourt player with the ability to move better than many similarly sized players, making him a big mismatch offensively at the college level with some translatable skills to the pros … Very good floor spacer, has a soft shooting touch and consistent shot mechanics from all 3 levels of the floor, and can do damage spotting up and hitting shots from long range (nearly 40% 3FG on 4.7 attempts), pulling up off the bounce and attacking closeouts, or using turnaround jumpers from the low or mid post … Also is effective in pick-and-pop situations, and shows budding ability to hit some jumpers with range off screens … Possesses a rangy 1st step that college frontcourt players struggled to defend all season when he attacked off the dribble, and knows how to slither in tight spaces or spin into the lane under control for high percentage shots when defenders happen to cut off his driving lanes … Solid post-up player, particularly when matched up on smaller players, and has a good command of jump hooks & up and under moves when he establishes position … More of a finesse player than physical, but shouldn’t be confused with a player who is afraid of contact in the paint, and will occasionally finish with authority at the rim … His huge production jump from his Freshman to Sophomore season (from 7.2 ppg to 23.5 ppg) is eye-opening and encouraging; but his shot selection to get that production was also outstanding (55% FG, career 54%) and he rarely looks like he’s forcing scoring opportunities outside of the offensive flow … Looks comfortable as a ball handler initiating transition opportunities after missed shots or turnovers … Will make some hustle plays and is active moving without the ball, gets a fair share of points without having plays drawn up for him as a cutter and in transition … Rebounds his area well (nearly 9 rpg), but is particularly effective as an offensive rebounder (nearly 3 Orpg as a Soph.) who regularly got put backs by being active on the glass and using his long arms … Effective shot-blocker (nearly 2 bpg as a Soph, career 1.6 bpg) showing nice timing and using his length to alter shots near the rim or get back into plays when beat off the bounce … Moves his feet well, rarely gets in foul trouble, and also has quick hands (over 1 spg); has the tools needed to be able to switch onto the perimeter and hold his own and sometimes even smother smaller matchups while guarding along the frontline as well … Gets to the line at a decent clip (over 5 attempts per game at around 75 FT%) … Doesn’t turn the ball over much (just 1.1 topg), especially for his usage … High IQ player and late bloomer who clearly works hard on his game giving his emergence from his 1st season to now …","Will have some questions about his true position at the next level; though his length allows him to play bigger than he is, at 6’8 he may be better suited as more of a PF or ‘small ball’ C than the combo forward he is seen as at the college level, especially as he fills out his frame … For as productive a scorer as he was for Iowa as a Soph., Murray didn’t quite prove to be a natural perimeter shot creator … Is comfortable handling in the open court and he’s hard to contain in the mid and high post, but he can be loose with the ball from the perimeter off the dribble and it’s tough to project him facing up and breaking down NBA level combo forwards on the perimeter consistently … Was an efficient shooter, but did have some inconsistency from deep this season at times and is still improving … Seems to prefer to drive and finish with his right, did have some awkward possessions when that side of the rim was cut off and he had to use his off hand … Defensively, Murray on occasion will rely too much on his length to gamble for steals/deflections by fronting post entry passes with no help around, and it can lead to easier shots in the paint when he’s unsuccessful … May struggle to defend on the perimeter as his lateral speed is not exceptional … May have been a function of his role on the team because he doesn’t seem selfish, but Murray doesn’t pass the ball much … Has underrated strength, but did at times struggle with his efficiency when defended by physical match ups who could contain his dribble penetration … Older than your average Soph. after spending a year in prep school before attending Iowa, will be 22 years old at the start of his rookie season …",12.3,0.087,0.8,TBD
62,"An aggressive explosive, 6’4 200 lb combo guard with solid length (wingspan rumored to be somewhere in the 6’7-6’9 range) and a strong frame that should allow him to match up well on the perimeter … Very quick-twitched, Ivey is a premier athlete in the 2022 draft class who runs the floor exceptionally well given his outstanding burst and speed, and has the explosive leaping ability off of one or two feet to play above the rim with ease … A terror in the open court, plays with a high motor and is always looking to attack and put pressure on the defense; whether filling the lanes for off ball run outs or handling the ball in transition himself … Attentive off the ball and will slip behind defenders for easy cuts to the rim if his match up is late to react/out of position..Finishes well at the basket even when contested amongst the trees, has enough power and touch to score through contact … Makes good things happen when the defense isn’t set but only needs half a step on his man to collapse the paint and get to the rim in the half court with or without a ball screen due to his very quick 1st step and long-striding speed … Ivey is comfortable driving and dishing and in pick and roll situations (especially going right); rewards Purdue’s big front court players with plenty of high percentage looks near the rim off the attention he gets from slashing (3.3 apg as a Soph.) … A really active, quick-handed defender who plays strong on-ball defense at the college level, but is just as adept at jumping passing lanes and causing deflections, likes to flip turnovers into points … Has the athleticism needed to get back in plays after getting beat, capable of making nice chase down blocks … Projects very well to being able to defend anywhere on the perimeter at the NBA level given his physical tools and intensity level, and is among the best overall defenders in this upcoming class … Also a willing rebounder (5.2 rpg) who looks to initiate offense off missed shots..A rapidly improving 3-point shooter (41% 3FG currently as a Soph. on 5 attempts per game, up from just 26% last season) who has made defenses pay when they give him space this season … Ivey possesses decent release speed and touch; has shown flashes of being able to make shots on the move using screens, but especially off the bounce and spotting up with his feet set … Has a couple of rangy step back moves he uses for separation at times to get his shot off … Sporadically uses runners and floaters in the mid-range area, both shots that would be useful to continue to develop considering his play style … Has become a very difficult match up at the college level with his improved shot, as it only adds to the pressure he can put on the defense and puts his matchups at his mercy for blow-bys when closing out on him … Rapidly improved overall scoring efficiency (just under 40% FG last season to 48% on increased volume so far as a Soph.) points to a hard working player who is playing to his strengths while putting in the time to improve his game elsewhere…Has fan favorite traits, given his energy level and highlight reel athleticism, but also will endear himself to coaches and teammates with his contagious effort and solid intangible traits…Gets to the foul line at a decent rate and is an OK FT shooter once he gets there (career 74% on just over 4 FTs per game)","Ivey’s hard charging energy and play style can be projected to be both a gift and a curse, as he can also straddle being too aggressive and being out of control on both ends … Gambles and reaches for steals and will pick up unnecessary fouls or get himself out of proper position, washing himself out of plays at times … High IQ players will undoubtedly be able to have some success using his aggressive approach against him, whether it be stepping in for charges or baiting him into live ball turnovers by getting caught in no man’s land … Offensively, if his speed doesn’t break down the help side level of the defense, he occasionally shows questionable patience and shot selection … Can stand to improve on switching up the pace he plays at more often … Should look to polish his mid-range game, would benefit from adding 1 and 2 dribble pull up shots when chased off the 3-point line …Improved passer but not quite a natural playmaker for others (3.3 apg/2.2 topg); leaves his feet to make passes often, which telegraphs and will allow  defenders the time to recover and close passing angles more quickly … Has some misdirection in his game, but is mostly an average ball-handler who prefers to use his speed and rangy strides to maneuver … Gets low lift on his jumper and shoots a set shot, which is less of a concern for him from the 3-point line given the improvement and shot-making range he’s shown this season, but it will likely make the development of his floaters and runners more imperative at the NBA level … Some consider him a potential point for the next level, but for now he is more of a wing than a true lead guard …",12.1,-0.001,-0.7,TBD
63,"6’7 wing with tremendous size, maturity, explosiveness and scoring skills that should help him make a quick transition to the next level … Elite spot-up shooter who can flourish in a lesser role early in his career before making strides to stardom later on … Shows some ability to utilize a floater … Aggressive slasher with a quick burst and powerful first step … Finishes with good strength and tremendous body control … Rim punisher who can bring the house down with athletic and pulverizing poster dunks (ie dunk vs TCU) … Plays with a ton of energy off the ball on offense with great cuts … Extremely athletic wing with good size for a scorer and long enough arms to be disruptive when he is locked in defensively … Sensational athlete who can elevate with anyone and really run in transition … Everyone on Arizona knows how to cut, but his change of direction is elite and he can create a lot of separation for himself in this department … Excellent form on his shot, with crisp mechanics and a consistent form … Incredible shooting range and big-shot maker with a ton of confidence (also see TCU game) … Good feel for his mid-range jumper and also makes decent reads in pick-and-roll action at the free-throw line … High energy offensive player who can crash the offensive glass with an NBA frame and plenty of upside at just 19-years-old until June … Clutch. High intangibles guy who really elevates his play in big situations … Very determined, hard working player as his immense improvement illustrates … Despite some lapses defensively, shows a ton of upside as a defender due to his athleticism and determination …","The biggest hurdle for Mathurin at this point is his inability to create offense consistently off the dribble … Defensive effort and intensity is  inconsistent … Still growing and learning the nuances of playing on the wing …  Doesn’t always work hard on box outs and can surrender a ton of offensive rebounds … Could struggle with high energy offensive players as most of his effort comes on the offensive end … Gets lost at times on the defensive end due to ball-watching and can get bullied when he does engage on box outs … Needs to show more energy in transition defense … Free-throw percentage took a dip from 84% to 76% but his volume went up and his mechanics are still sound … Lateral quickness and anticipation is a step behind on defense with smaller guards able to blow past him … Self-creation will need some time to develop, but he has the tools and potential to make this a strength in a few years time … Doesn’t possess the biggest wingspan, but appears to have solid length, with a wingspan likely a few (2-3) inches longer than his height …",13.1,0.038,-1.0,TBD

Played heavy minutes as a lead guard with the ball in his hands, but didn’t read the floor or run his teams offense well enough to justify it … Nothing more than a mediocre passer (2.8 : 2.7 A:TO with a 130 usage rate) for a player who was projected as a combo guard in HS … Sometimes Edwards can struggle to contribute when his shots aren’t falling … Had poor efficiency (40% FG and 29% 3FG on 7 attempts a game), partly due to him taking bad shots but also due to usage and the type of extra attention he saw as a Fr … Played on a bad UGA team that was not going to make the NCAA Tournament field in 2020, which is concerning for a prospect in the running to be selected in the top half of the lottery …Can improve as a free throw shooter.

Shoots it well from deep and has good arc on shot, most of his makes find the bottom of the net. Hits shots from the NBA 3PT line and is a threat to score from literally anywhere in the half court. His jump shot keeps the defense tense and they must guard him tight away from the basket. Good free throw shooter … Gets to the rim off the dribble, using an effective crossover. Good variety and craft as a finisher. Finishes very well in the paint and in traffic, uses glass when appropriate. Good touch on floater … Good ambidexterity, doesn’t hesitate to use either hand dribbling, passing, or finishing. Creative playing style. Very good ballhandler.

In one case, two full years younger …","His overall jump shot lacks any real consistency at the moment, and just like his older brother that can likely be attributed to his highly unorthodox shooting form … His release point is low, somewhere between his chin and his chest, and he shoots a set shot with below average elevation, leading to plenty of flat shots and bad misses whether open or contested (25% from 3point range on 6 attempts per game in 2019) … His mediocre FT shooting (72%) points to him potentially becoming a reasonably efficient shooter in time, but he’s a work in progress …. Ball’s shot selection will also need to improve, as he made just enough deep shots to both keep the defense honest, as well as justify (mostly to himself) that he should at times hoist low percentage shots off the dribble from all over the court … While a pretty good athlete, he is more smooth than dynamic and will only sporadically try to play above the rim in the half court … Should continue to add weight and strength to his improving frame, as he currently gets outmuscled by players with similar size on both ends of the court … Has some experience playing off the ball, but clearly is more effective making plays with the ball in his hands … At times can be turnover prone looking to make the home-run play when a simpler play is available … Doesn’t show any real consistent toughness or effort defensively, mostly interested in jumping passing lanes for run outs or trying to swipe for steals … Rarely stays alert or in a stance for full defensive possessions, has issues fighting through screens and may struggle to defend quicker PGs as a young pro … Seems like the type of player who will be asked to defend the other team’s worst perimeter scorer as he develops, but his defensive versatility (and effectiveness) could improve as he gets stronger and shows more awareness, largely due to his physical tools … There have been whispers that some teams may see Ball’s more nonchalant approach as a player as a questionable investment for a potential franchise player and top draft choice, though his improvement over the past few years seems to point to a determined, hard working young player …Smooth but not an incredibly explosive athlete. Doesn’t get much pop off two feet or in half court situations, especially compared to other guards in his class … Set point on shot is a bit low and he tends to fade a bit at times. Shot selection can improve, he’s a threat to score from anywhere but sometimes pulls up for deep and contested shots that aren’t necessary … Thrives in a fast-paced game, with that can come loose play and high turnovers … Skinny, lacks strength in both the upper and lower body … Can get more action off the ball, tends to drift at times.

Can learn to play with more sense of urgency and force the issue, considering his talent edge … Shows tons of untapped potential, but whether he will be able to tap that ability is the question mark. How badly does he “want it”? … He likely will be a player that really benefits from a good development situation at the next level, or may not make it with his first team if he lands in the wrong situation … Jump shot is a little slow and mechanical. Will need to work on speeding up his release some, specifically from deep … Appears to have better form when shooting pull ups than spot ups … Seems to shoot a jumpshot from mid-range and a set shot from deep. Perhaps learning to get more of a streamline form from deep would increase his shot release quickness and efficiency …Can be too content letting the game come to him and can improve aggression.

Does not create his own shot very well against top athletes and struggles in isolation … Lack of a quick first step makes it tough to get past quality defenders, and also allows opponents to play him close … Average athlete by NBA standards lacking fluidity and explosiveness  … Overall speed and quickness (both laterally and vertically) leaves something to be desired, but can improve … Defense remains a work in progress and something he will need to focus on in order to earn playing time at the next level … Doesn’t crash the boards on the offensive end, but usually isn’t inside the perimeter to begin with … Can make simple passes, but looking to create for others in the half-court isn’t really part of his game … Sometimes panics when double-teamed or rushed, prefers to play at his own pace … Seems to shy away from contact at the rim, preferring to go for an acrobatic lay-up or pull-up… At times, confidence in his jumper can lead to seemingly forced shots with better ones available from his teammates (granted at 52% from three, that is nit picking)… Relies on length rather than quickness on defense, allows quicker players to get by him … Does not block shots, but can step in and alter some … Most weaknesses are easily correctable with the right coaching, but he’s not fully formed yet …",9.6,0.055,-1.0,TBD

202,"Udoka Azubuike’s most obvious strength is pretty hard to miss. He is very big. At 7 feet .25 inches in shoes, and possessing an elite 7’7” wingspan he’s extremely long. Even better, after years in the weight room he’s molded himself into a lean, muscular 260 pound athlete. Dok can hold his own with the biggest and strongest of NBA centers. His size and length give him immediate translatable skills like rebounding and the ability to defend the rim. Azubuike isn’t a stiff either. At the 2020 combine he measured a freakish 37 inch max standing vertical leap, which allowed him to hit the 12’6” mark without any sort of run. After averaging 2.6 blocks per game as a senior at Kansas, Udoka’s size and spring will render him at the very least a plus rim defender in the NBA with the potential to be elite. While not the quickest lateral player his 7’7” wingspan also makes him extremely effective guarding the entire paint area, and extremely effective in one on one post matchups, help and rotational situations in the lane. Even in a more spaced out environment, he would be a major deterrent for offensive players to test their luck in the paint. While not a guy you really want running around by the 3 point line, he’s developed into a solid pick and roll defender too with the ability to effectively switch and stay out of foul trouble. Dok truly was a historic figure in NCAA D1 Hoops. Over four seasons at Kansas he shot .7465% from the field, good for first all time. No, Azubuike isn’t going to impress you with a vast array of post moves, but he is an extremely effective finisher, with the length and girth to be a high level pick and roll target and finisher at the rim at the NBA level. Chances are if he gets the ball in the low post, he’s going to score. Dok upped his rebounding every season at Kansas, and his 10.5 rebounds per game as a senior (3.5 offensive) are good indicators that he’ll be able to collect misses at a good clip at the next level. Over four years he really transformed his body. Dok lost fat, gained muscle and athleticism, and improved endurance which really aided in being in the position to be talked about entering the NBA draft. While not your typical face up big man of 2020, Dok is good enough at what he does (and good enough to be able to do it in the NBA) to be looked at as a potential draft pick or two way player.

Has great length with a 7’5 wingspan. Takes up a lot of space and holds position against the biggest opponents … Plays physical and likes to bang.

No doubt Dok is more comfortable as an offensive player than he was as a freshman, but he’s never really developed the ability to hit a face up jump shot. This makes his only value on offense strictly around the rim. His projected failure to draw his defender away from the hoop will allow defenses to sag off and contend the rim easier. His lack of improvement as a free throw shooter doesn’t exactly paint a trajectory of developing even a consistent 15 footer over the next few years. Udoka shot just 44% from the free throw stripe as a senior, and that was a career high. He is also not a naturally quick lateral defender. His focus on conditioning has certainly allowed him to improve, but guarding face up bigs one on one in the NBA often 20-25 feet away from the basket could make him an easier target to blow past, or exploit by a stretch 5 with three point range.Still very raw in terms of skillset. Doesn’t provide much outside the paint. Can improve his post-game and footwork. Can improve his face up game and free throw shooting … Foul prone. Uses hands too much on defense and can develop a better understanding of defensive positioning … Even though his size and length stand out even at the highest levels, he will need to add more to his offensive game. He gets by with simply catching and finishing at the high school level … Needs to improve conditioning, gets winded throughout the game.

Will have questions about his attitude on the court, displayed poor body language and often seen sulking when things didn’t go his way … Possibly even more troubling, McDaniels picked up 5 technical fouls in his Fr season, which is only compounded by the fact that a “tech” in college is also both a personal and team foul … A headlining recruit for a young Washington team, but their season was a big disappointment relative to preseason expectations this past season …Still improving as a three-point shooter. Shot 29.2% 3P% at 4.1 attempts per game over the Nike EYBL in 2018 … Half-court offense has a way to go, as well as playing off the ball. Offense can be predictable. Tends to settle for contested pull-ups even in transition. Can improve getting to the rim and scoring off the dribble … Must be more assertive, tends to blend in … Can get more action playing off the ball, tends to settle for spotting up on the perimeter … Can develop a post-game to utilize size mismatches around the basket … Solid passing ability but telegraphs passes at times and can limit the turnovers.

205,"Has something very valuable in today’s NBA landscape, and that is high level shooting. As a senior, Bane nailed 42% of his three point attempts, and posted a 3 point percentage over 40% in 3 full NCAA seasons. Bane has excellent range on his jumper, and great in spot up situations as well as shooting off the dribble. He’d be an immediate asset to an NBA team spacing the floor at the two spot. At 6’6” Bane possesses a chiseled frame, and high level strength that will be able to handle the rigors of an NBA season, and larger opponents. His 16.6 points as a senior were primarily earned from the perimeter, but Desmond does have the ability to get into the lane and is very good at using his powerful body to take impact and create distance from opposing shot blockers. Nice touch around the rim, and solid ability to adjust in mid air while getting to the hoop. A smart player who had to become more of a distributor during his senior season. He averaged 3.9 assists per game, and was very good at making the “right” pass, and even showed a little bit of ability to run a pick and roll. At 6’6” he was a very good rebounding guard at the college level hauling in 6.3 boards per contest and even notching 4 double doubles with points and rebounds. Defensively he puts in the work, and while not projected as an elite NBA defender, he could do well in a team scheme. He has active hands and stole the ball 1.5 times per game, and is a good vertical athlete who can contest shots.","While Desmond Bane is tall, strong, and a good vertical athlete he’s not really the total package in terms of physicality. Despite being 6’6” tall, he only has a 6’4.25” wingspan, which makes him one of the few players at this level of basketball to have a wingspan shorter than their height. This limits his defensive potential a bit in the NBA. Again, Bane can get off the ground, but lateral quickness isn’t something that is a strong suit for him. He puts forth tons of effort on the court, which will help him, but when trying to get in the lane off the dribble, or trying to guard a quick player, it’s just going to be harder at the NBA level for someone who’s not naturally quick, or particularly fast at changing directions. Does not really project as an NBA player with a lot of positional versatility. Is likely to play the shooting guard on offense, and guard the shooting guard on defense, with maybe a small portion of small forwards. NBA point guards could likely be too quick for him, and a large portion of small forwards could prove to be too long.

213,"Lee was a prolific scorer at Vanderbilt, especially when fellow star Aaron Nesmith went down with an injury last season. Lee took over the Commodores offense with an average of 18.6 points per game as a junior … He is an explosive player who gets to the rim at will and finishes well when he gets there. His slashing ability and playmaking are his greatest strengths as he tries to improve his perimeter shooting game … Lee averaged over four assists per game in his final season and got to the line over six times per game in his final two seasons. He improved from 67% to 75% in these attempts from the line in his final season … He is a fierce defender who averaged at least a steal per game in all three seasons at Vanderbilt. His 6’9 wingspan at only 6’2 is very enticing and combined with his speed and quickness, he looks to be a nightmare to guard on the ball and to go up against as the on-ball defender … Lee shot 55% on two-point shots as a junior showing how great he is around the rim, especially with his massive volume with 13 shots per game … Great ball-handling and quick twitches also make Lee formidable in isolations … Lee is one of the more interesting players in his class because of his long wingspan and great explosiveness. His mix of size and speed will make him a rookie to watch with such a high ceiling.","While Lee has great measurements and athleticism, his jump shot is just as unusual as his long wingspan on a small body. He shot only 33% in his three-year career and his shooting form is very unorthodox. He will certainly be a project and will have to rely on his slashing ability to make up for a lack of a jump shot early on in his career … Lee handled the ball a lot in his final season, but three turnovers per game is also hard to look past. He will have to take better care of the ball at the next level in order to get meaningful minutes … Off-ball defending became an issue a little too often and will have to improve rather quickly in his career … Lee has the quickness, but strength will be a major question mark. He will need to be able to fight through harder screens and go up with taller, stronger defenders on these drives that he was so effective with in college. He could get pushed around much more than he was at Vandy with a short off-season and less time to bulk up with a true, professional workout regimen.",13.7,0.084,0.3,TBD

Finished a lot of plays with finger rolls and got his shot blocked around the rim a fair amount … Limited upside as he turned 22 on March 10th … A good shooter, but his three point percentage dipped to 34% with a lot of pressure put on him to score from the perimeter … Defense is a concern as he will need to re-learn some of the basics of spacing and man defense, having spent two years at Syracuse following his transfer from East Carolina … Over confidence in his shooting leads to too many shots from too far outside the three point arch. While he has the range, his tendency to launch shots 5 feet beyond the line raises some question marks … Appears that he could tone his body some … Can be over ambitions with his passing at times, trying to thread a needle or look for the spectacular play …",5.8,-0.039,-0.5,TBD
215,"Woodard made a name for himself in the SEC as a defensive force both on the perimeter and in the post … He averaged both a steal and a block per game as a sophomore, but his effect and impact went far beyond the stat sheet … He has a 7’2 wingspan which allows him to be disruptive on handoffs and elevate at the rim with taller big men … Woodard also improved immensely from year one to year two in Starkville. He improved his three-point shooting from 27% to 43% and averaged over 11 points per game for the Bulldogs … Woodard also improved driving to the basket. He has great bounce and showed it on some powerful dunks. He also uses this bounce effectively to hang in the air longer and maneuver his body around defenders while still in the air. This allows him to have great finishing above and around the rim … He also showed smart and effective movement off the ball allowing him to get some easy buckets at the rim … He positions himself well in the post and gets up for rebounds as he averaged over six per game in 33 minutes per contest … His aggressive defensive playstyle did not lead to many fouls with an average of under two fouls per game … He looked much more comfortable from beyond the arc in his second season and was very effective as a spot up shooter … He also looked sharper with his pull-up jumper and showed potential with his mid-range shooting … Woodard’s best trait is undoubtedly his hustle and his effort. He was the heartbeat of the Bulldogs squad and this high work ethic will allow him to find a spot on a team and work his way up. While he may not be drafted, he will not disappear and will almost certainly get a chance somewhere because of this determination …","Woodard makes up for a lot of his weaknesses with his hard work and hustle but there are still some glaring weaknesses in his game … He is only 6’7 so he needs to have much better ball-handling than he does right now … This poor ball-handling eliminates any possibility for him to be a facilitator or a shot creator. He struggles to get open on his own and he requires a lot of space to make three pointers because of his very slow, Draymond Green-like release. He improved his three-point shooting but it came at a cost as he needs his lower body to squat down and release his shot slowly. He will need to increase the speed of his jumper if he is going to have any success … He will have to play as a rebounding, defending power forward with the potential to spread the floor if he can make his jump shot faster. Again, because of his size this will be a tough transition going up against much larger and stronger NBA forwards … His free-throw shooting is also a cause for concern. He shot only 58% as a freshman and 64% as a sophomore … He is not outstanding in anything that he does, outside of his hustle and effort. He is a very good defender and a good rebounder, but he did not dominate enough in either of these categories in college to suggest that he will do so at the next level.",7.5,-0.077,-0.1,TBD

Finished top five in steals over the Nike EYBL with 1.9 per game …","Shooting consistency is probably the most glaring weakness. Although, he was able to answer critics with solid shooting numbers and improvement as season progressed … Can be a streaky shooter, taking longer than desired to realize he doesn’t have it on a given night … Release is a little slow, seems to lack confidence sometimes … Perhaps it was due to system, but his pick and roll game is still in need of refinement … Can run simple pick and roll as a ball-handler, but doesn’t explode off the edge or thread the needle to the roller … Defenses really challenged him to hit shots while at Duke, especially since he was deadly as a set up guy and had a lot of talent around him … Athleticism is slightly below average for today’s NBA point guard … Plays below the rim, quick but not explosive … Struggles to create his own shot and get past better defenders off the dribble … Not a primary creator, may needs talent around him to take the eye off of him … Struggles to finish amongst the trees … Shows some crafty ability, but doesn’t deal with contact too well … When switched on defense, can be a liability because of size … Can grab long rebounds, but obviously can’t compete with bigger players … Smaller frame (6’2  and 185 lbs.) for an NBA lead guard (6’4”” wingspan), though not terrible …The main area of concern with Jones right now is his shooting … He doesn’t shoot very much, and doesn’t shoot it at a high percentage when he does fire away … He hesitates fairly often when he has an open look from outside, which either stems from his release being on the longer side, or just Jones lacking confidence in his shot. Jones is also on the smaller side for an NBA point guard. He has room to fill out his frame as well, and could benefit greatly from putting on weight in preparation for the draft. While he’s listed at 6’2, which is essentially the minimum height you’ll see for guards in today’s NBA, he looks to be a little shorter than that.

shot, Graham shot .40% from deep as a senior, and sported three point percentages over 40% for three of his four years at Kansas … Devonte has shown the ability to shoot both off the dribble, and as a spot up shooter … Graham has consistently shown his capability to extend his range out past the NBA line as well … His long range shooting will certainly translate to the current NBA landscape … Graham is also well adept at running the pick, and roll and is excellent at throwing lobs in P/R situations … After playing off the ball much of his first three seasons, Graham showed he could really operate as a point guard during his senior season … His assists rose to 7.2 per contest, while still only turning the ball over 2.8 times per game … Devonte’s ability to control the game while being ball dominant paired with his experience playing next to high volume shooters such as Frank Mason, Josh Jackson, and Wayne Selden makes him a versatile option for an NBA franchise … He’s perfectly adept to helping his teammates shine, but as he showed his senior season, he has the skills to up his game when needed (17.2 ppg in 2017-2018) … At 6’2” and with a seemingly long wingspan for his height, Graham isn’t a large point guard, but he certainly is big enough to be considered solid sized for an NBA one … His defense was often overlooked, but is a heady player on the defensive end who can really make life tough for his opponent … In the NBA, he won’t be asked to carry nearly the offensive load he did at Kansas, and I feel he’ll be a capable NBA defender against the majority of NBA point guards … He tallied 197 steals while at Kansas, and has always been effective in the passing lanes due to his high overall basketball IQ … A competitor, who shows a willingness to challenge teammates to raise their level of play in big moments … Graham is a high quality leader, and individual, who is mature and ready to enter professional basketball from a personal standpoint …  Weaknesses: Devonte Graham, while possessing decent size and length, is still a little thin for an NBA guard … Listed at 185 pounds, he could stand to add some strength … Athletically he’s average, showing good quickness, and the ability to get off the ground, but he’s not a standout by NBA standards … Could be taken out of games mentally if he gets frustrated … A poor shooting start in games potentially means he will stop looking for shots and instead look to distribute the ball instead … This strategy, while unselfish, often hurt the Jayhawks who at times struggled to find scoring during 2017-18 … Only shot .40% from the floor in his senior season, but this is more due to the massive offensive burden he took on for the Jayhawks … I suspect his shot selection will improve in the professional ranks when he’s not asked to do so much for his team … While showing improvement every season in college, Graham turned 23 years old in February and therefore is likely not to be viewed as a player with much upside left to develop … His age is likely to effect his draft stock …"," Devonte Graham, while possessing decent size and length, is still a little thin for an NBA guard …

Can pin point full court outlet passes to start breaks. Great timing and finds teammates when they’re in position to score … Great ball handler and floor general. Gets where he wants with the ball. High basketball IQ and ideal point guard traits. Brings out the best in his teammates. Can play alongside other great players, isn’t hindered by others taking the shots … Plays even keeled and nonchalant and doesn’t get rattled. Doesn’t force his impact on the game. Can play with the ball in his hands as well as off the ball … Has shooting range out to the three point line … Standout athlete that can finish plays above the rim … Great rebounder on both ends for a guard and impacts the game in multiple statistical categories. Averaged a triple-double for his senior year while going undefeated … Good size and willingness as a defender … Possesses great quickness and shows excellent anticipation …","Ball has an outstanding combination of size, length, and athleticism, but his frame is not filled out yet, and he can struggle with more physical guards at times … This also hinders his ability to consistently get into the paint off the dribble … Wears a leg sleave and his legs appear to be underdeveloped … He has terrific speed but does not possess the quickest first step, which will make it more challenging to put pressure on the defense in the NBA … The biggest knock on Ball at this stage is his inability to consistently create his own offense when things break down … Ball is not great in isolation and generally his pick and roll possessions end up as a passer … He very infrequently used the pick to get into the paint and find his own offense … He also rarely showed signs of any mid-range game or the ability to pull up off the dribble … Ball will likely need to play alongside several other offensive threats to be able to generate his own offense in spurts … Where his awkward shooting mechanics can be exploited is off the dribble … On the one hand, Ball converted on 48.6% of his jumpers off the dribble, a number that was near the top in college basketball … However, rarely did he attempt such shots this season, and most of them were step-back three pointers rather than mid range pull ups … His inability to pull up in the mid-range is a function of his extremely slow shooting mechanics. Ball’s low release point and need to come back across his body certainly seem to factor into his inability to get his jumper off when pulling up off the dribble, and he has almost no in-between game because of it … He will need to develop a somewhat quicker release if he ever wants to be effective in this facet of the game … A lot of Ball’s baskets in the half-court at the rim were assisted, which indicates his ability to move off the ball along with his struggles creating his own shot off the dribble … On the defensive side of the court, Ball is adept at forcing turnovers, but he does not have the overall impact that his physical tools would suggest … Ball struggles at times containing dribble penetration against quicker guards, which was particularly exposed against De’Aaron Fox, who exploded for 39 points against him in the NCAA Tournament … Ball also does not have great awareness when being screened, and he also could show more consistent effort to fight through screens and recover … Ball is an intriguing prospect, but his weaknesses are well documented, and he will need to be surrounded by the right personnel to achieve optimal success … Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounding Ball has nothing to do with his game whatsoever … Some NBA execs view his father, LaVar as a potential problem with his ""over involvement"" and the endless controversial comments he has made over the last few months … The hope is that he will fade into the background and not be too involved with Lonzo’s day to day decision making, and ultimately career. Time will tell …While he can make shots from outside, he has an extremely unorthodox, even ugly, shooting form … Tends to fling the ball from the left side of his face … Has a lot of room to add strength … Good athlete but not incredibly explosive … Played a loose, up tempo style at Chino Hills, will need to work on valuing possessions and making the sound play moving forward …",13.4,0.067,6.3,N
358,"Tatum lived up to lofty expectations placed upon him in his freshman season at Duke, as a result of being heralded as a top-five high-school recruit by virtually every recruiting database … Despite the fact that he missed the first eight games of the season with a foot injury, Tatum developed into an absolute superstar by the end of the season for the Blue Devils, averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 boards, and 2.3 assists per game … Tatum’s NBA potential begins with his prototypical physical profile for a wing player … Standing at 6-8, with a 6-11 wingspan, he has an excellent frame that appears will fill out over time with broad shoulders and great hip mobility for his size … Tatum is a fluid athlete with long strides in the open court and the ability to cover a lot of ground … Another great tool Tatum offers is his ability to play small ball four man in short stretches like he did frequently at Duke. His uncommon skillset is visible right away in his ability to corral defensive rebounds and push the ball up the court effortlessly in transition … He is also great on the fast break off the ball, as he understands how to fill lanes correctly and get himself an easy finish at the rim … His impressively long strides also come to play in the half court, where he can catch from the arc and get all the way to the tin in one dribble … He has great extension when finishing at the rim, and his long wingspan allows him to finish above the rim in space … Tatum’s most intriguing selling point, however, is his highly advanced offensive skillset in the half court, and his NBA ready scoring ability … He is an exceptionally polished scorer for a 19 year old, having the ability to operate from all three levels. He is at his best in the mid-range area where he can create space and shoot over the top of the defense with a high release point on his jumper … He also has outstanding footwork and is never too sped up by the defense … Tatum excels out of the mid-post area as well where he has a variety of moves in his arsenal to beat his man … One of his weaknesses coming out of high school was his below average spot-up shooting from three-point territory … Tatum has improved in this area, as he is most certainly a capable threat from deep, especially off the drive and kick … He has also always been a terrific free-throw shooter (84.9% this season), which provides plenty of promise for further improvement down the road … He is also a good pick and pop threat when needed to play the four … He is particularly strong with his one dribble pull-up jumper going to his left, and he just does a great overall job of attacking hard closeouts with superb footwork … Tatum is probably the best isolation scorer in the draft as well … He utilizes a variety of hesitation pull-ups, jab steps, step backs, crossovers, spins, etc., and he can stop on a dime with ease to get into his shot … He was an absolute nightmare four opposing four men to guard, especially in the mid range, where he used his shiftiness and creativity to get into his mid-range game at will … He also is great at changing speeds in isolation situations to keep his defender off balance and get to the rim … Tatum is a handful to guard when facing up in the post … Defenders have to respect his ability to rise into his jump shot, but he counters this well with an explosive first step off the dribble going to his right … He also employs an occasional Dirk-like fall away jumper that is nearly impossible to guard, and he is great overall feel for where the defender is when posting up … He is still improving as a playmaker, but he has good vision in transition and can see over the top of the defense off the pick and roll … Tatum also has the tools to hold his own on the defensive end in the NBA as well in large part due to his size and length … He slides his feet very well when locked in and uses his length to his advantage (1.4 blocks and 1.6 steals per 40 minutes) … He can cover a lot of ground when closing out on shooters, as he would often run all the way from the ball side of the court and force a difficult shot when the ball was skipped over to his man … He also has the agility to contain quick perimeter players off the dribble and the length to consistently force contested shots … He shows flashes of great instincts and can cover a lot of ground rotating from the weak side to protect the rim … Tatum has good hands off the ball and anticipates passing lanes well … He proved to be a factor on the defensive glass, posting a clip 7.2 d-boards per 40 minutes … His professional approach to the game and work ethic are also noteworthy … He consistently demonstrated the ability to stay calm in pressure situations and come up big in crunch time … His game will fit well in the NBA, and he should be an immediate impact scorer … He is one of the more unique players in this draft and can be considered a low-risk, high-reward player …6’8 smooth and versatile wing prospect … Good size, length, and fluidity for a wing. Uses size and length to shoot over defenders. Good half-court offensive game … Can score and distribute out of the high post … Transitions well from set shooting position into a low driving position and vice versa … Advanced footwork. Uses pivots, step backs, and fade aways … Very good midrange scorer and has begun to extend his shooting range … Can score from multiple spots on the floor … Handles the ball well and has solid court vision. Can create for himself off the dribble … Has shown the ability to facilitate with the ball in his hands over his high school career … Does an excellent job of forcing contact and getting to the foul line … Understands how to play around the rim, can be a mismatch for smaller defenders as well as challenge bigger defenders … High level rebounder for a wing … Strong competitor. Seems to have self awareness and plays for the team … Solid defender, has the tools and ability to guard multiple positions … Shows surprising leadership for a player his age … Doesn’t have any major weaknesses to his game …","One of the first flaws that jump out in Tatum’s game is his inconsistent intensity on defense … At times, he seems to just go through the motions defensively and didn’t demonstrate the competitive desire to lock his man down … In addition, he is an excellent small-ball four on offense, but the same cannot be said about his defensive impact from this position … He is not physical enough to handle bigger players down low, and he needs to add some strength to his lower half … His technique on the perimeter can improve, as his closeouts can be quite lazy, allowing for his man to get by him with little resistance … He is also not the most physical perimeter defender and can do a better job of getting in his stance and containing the dribble … In transition, he does not always sprint back to the paint to help out against penetrating guards in the open court … In an NBA game nowadays that is heavily predicated on up-tempo offense with an abundance of quick guards who love to get in the lane on the break, this is something that he must address … One of the other question marks is that he is still a streaky spot-up shooter … He shot 34.3% from the arc at Duke this past season, which is not bad, but it is not good enough to classify him as an elite knockdown shooter … He is much better as a mid-range shooter and there are questions about if he will be able to adapt to the expanded three-point line in the NBA … Off the catch, his mechanics do not look quite as fluid when he is contested, and he is not always balanced on his release, which can also be a bit quicker … He also must become a more reliable scoring threat off the pick and roll … In these situations, defenders would mostly go under the ball screen, and he frequently would not make them pay with his pull up when this happened … Tatum also was guarded mostly by power forwards, so there are concerns about whether he will be able to create offense as effectively against NBA caliber wing players … His handle can be tightened, as he plays a bit too upright with the ball, making him less explosive … He does not have great burst from a stand still position, which causes him to struggle getting to the rim, and he has trouble finishing against top tier length and athleticism … This forces him to heavily rely on tough floaters and two-point jumpers, which is an inefficient way to score … Tatum can further refine his decision making on offense, as he can be too dependent on isolation offense, even if he excels in these situations … He is not the most comfortable playmaker on the move, and because of his inconsistent spot-up shooting in addition to that; there are questions about his effectiveness off the ball … These few factors will determine how high Tatum’s ceiling is …A high level athlete, but not a jump out of the gym freak … Lacks strength for physical play at higher levels but should add strength in time … Has the ability to make difficult shots but tends to settle for deep contested shots. Fades away at times when it’s unnecessary … Shooting is decent, but in need of improvement. Form doesn’t show any major issues, but is more of a solid shooter than knockdown at this point … Can improve range and consistency as a three point shooter … Can improve finishing in traffic by adding strength … Very long and smooth, but lacks a great burst off the dribble. First step is just average … Tends to over-dribble at times … Likely a 3 as his lack of great foot speed limits his effectiveness off the dribble, and his size and shooting fits the 3 position …",19.7,0.147,19.9,N

Good instincts, knowing when to jump for blocks and when to stay on his feet … Rebounds well … Improved his scoring in the post more when he was defended by a smaller guard … Serves as an all-around player and impacts the game in multiple categories … Clutch gene.

He can get hot from outside but can still add consistency, still has a slight hitch in his shot that causes him to release the ball on the way down … Passionate player but can wear his emotions at times … Older for his grade by quite a bit. Will turn 20 in February of his freshman season …Still has room to tighten up his ball handling, can get sloppy throughout the game … Also has room to become a more consistent jump shooter … While he has no problem breaking down the defense from the perimeter, becoming a consistent scoring threat from outside would do wonders for Jackson’s game … Has a tendency to take plays off or settle when he should be involved with every play … Should post up more when having a guard or smaller wing guarding him … Utilizing his physical tools and natural athleticism to expose mismatches closer to the basket would add another dimension to an already nearly unstoppable player …",11.4,-0.012,-3.1,N

He projects to be among the NBA’s most elusive guards from day one … His elite burst and ball handling allow him to create via the pick and roll or isolation (21.2 points per 40 minutes), and he does a good job of drawing contact and getting to the free throw line (7.5 free throw attempts per 40 minutes) … Fox still needs to add more consistency with his shot, but he is a capable mid range shooter off the dribble with sound mechanics … His jumper in the long run is encouraging as he gets great elevation and releases the ball high … When he cannot get all the way to the rim, he utilizes an impressive floater with good touch … He combines his quickness with the ability to drive with either hand, and he does a great job of changing gears with the ball in his hands … He uses a variety of dribble moves and counter moves to freeze his defender from hang dribbles, hesitations, hard crosses, in and outs, etc … Fox also demonstrates great footwork on his crossover into his pull up jump shot, where he is capable of knocking it down if the defense sags off too far … Off the pick and roll, he is an absolute mismatch for big men that occasionally get caught switching on him; he will use hard in and out dribbles that cover a lot of ground to blow by defenders and get to the basket … He can also cover a lot of ground with the dribble and rarely is there any wasted movement with the ball … Despite being taller for a lead guard, he has a low dribble that makes him much more explosive and difficult to contain … He is constantly keeping the defense guessing by playing high to low and slow to fast, which really aids him when his jumper is not working for him … Fox is not an elite facilitator yet, but he has solid vision (5.8 assists per 40 minutes) … His ability to collapse the defense on the drive points towards high upside as a playmaker … He also has the size to see over the top of the defense with an improving pick and roll game as well … Fox has good vision in space and always keeps his head up in transition, showing the ability to deliver accurate passes with either hand to teammates running the floor … Fox has outstanding potential as a defender as well with his size, length, lateral quickness, and instincts … He also has elite reaction time with quick hands and high activity off the ball … At times he will pressure full court and make it very difficult for opposing ball handlers to initiate an offense … He shows great motor in this end of the court as well, as he does en exemplary job of helping off the ball, and still closing out to his man under control when the ball is kicked out.

More of a scorer than consistent shooter right now … Has a slight frame. Very light at 175 pounds … Lacks ideal strength in both upper and lower body, although he has added some muscle tone over the past year … Can score in traffic but playing through contact will be an obstacle at the college level and beyond … Definitely shows good passing ability but can put too much heat on passes at unnecessary times.

Shows long term potential to defend multiple positions but struggles keeping position defending the post, causing him to pick up fouls.

362,"Markkanen was one of the top freshmen in college basketball last season, despite a middle of the year shooting slump, scoring 15.6 points per game on 42% shooting from beyond the arc … Markkanen’s combination of size and skill makes him one of the more intriguing prospects in the draft, and he will have the chance to develop into a valued stretch-four man in the Association … He is mature young man and appeared to be an exceptionally focused and likable teammate in his one year at Arizona … Markkanen’s upside starts with his outstanding size for an NBA power forward at 7-0 and 230 pounds … He is a fluid athlete with great coordination for his size … Most of the intrigue with him, however, is his unique offensive skillset … Markkanen is a high-IQ player that knows how to play the game very efficiently … As mentioned above, Markkanen shot 42% from distance on 5.9 attempts per 40 minutes, and he may actually be the best shooter in this draft regardless of position … He has smooth mechanics, a soft touch, and good balance off the catch … He is not only lethal off the catch, but he is also a prolific shooter on the move off of screens, pull-ups, face-up jumpers out of the post, etc … He particularly showed these abilities off earlier in the year when teammate Allonzo Trier was out for the earlier part of the season, causing him to play a lot of small forward and rely on more perimeter scoring … With more spacing at the NBA level, he will be a tremendous pick and pop threat and be able to maximize his shooting ability … Markkanen moves well without the ball when looking to spot up from the perimeter, and he knows how to find the open spot on the arc to get off a good look … His mechanics also stay consistent even when his shot is contested … He always gets his feet under him and does not waste any motion from catch to release … He runs off of screens like a guard, as he gets his feet set quickly and appears to be very comfortable rising into his shot here … In addition, he has great footwork when chased off the three-point line and can effortlessly shoot the ball off the dribble, especially going to his left … He even showed flashes of pull-up jumpers as a pick and roll ball handler in his arsenal, something extremely rare for his size … His agility for his 7-0, 238 pound frame jumps out, as he is decently effective off the bounce, which will be key for him going forward when defenders chase him off the arc … He has a pretty quick first step that is definitely good enough to get by many of the players that will be guarding him in the NBA … He is very good going to his left with the ability to put it on the floor and finish going left just as comfortably as he does with his right … Markkanen is not a high level athlete, but he can finish above the rim in space due to his superior height and decent leaping ability for his size … He also does a solid job of attacking the offensive glass for a stretch-four man … He does a great job of stepping out and hedging ball screens as well, a situation he will probably be in quite often in today’s pick and roll heavy NBA. Markkanen’s role in the NBA will be clearly defined as a stretch-four man, who can thrive in the role of instant offense off the bench or something along the lines of what Ryan Anderson brings to Houston …  Weaknesses: As skilled as Markkanen is on the offensive end, he offers nowhere near the same potential on defense … His lack of strength is a major soncern as he gets toseed around pretty easily by NCAA bigs and already has filled out with broad shoulders … His core and leg strength need a lot of work, and may never allow him to battle inside against the NBA’s top post players … He does not have great length, limiting his ability to protect the rim, and being thin for his height, he plays a lot smaller than his size … He may be more of a mismatch as a stretch-five man on offense, but the flip side is that he may not have any chance to slow down most centers on the defensive end … As mentioned, Markkanen’s lack of a strong base hinders his ability to battle for position in the post … He is also not very physical down low, and he does not have the length to contest shots from other post players to make up for his inability to fight for good position … Combine his lack of length with just average timing and instincts, and he could be a potential liability on this end of the court … On the perimeter he has good feet, but he has a tendency to bend his back instead of his knees to get down in his stance, which eliminates some lateral quickness and effectiveness … He is a nightmare to guard as a stretch-four on offense, but he often gets lost when trying to defend opposing stretch-fours on the perimeter … His intincts in defending the pick and roll and knowing when to come help from the weak side also needs to improve … His rebounding ability is also less than stellar for many of the same reasons that his defensive upside is limited … Markkanen averaged an underwhelming 9.3 rebounds per 40 minutes, as he lacks the length, range, and toughness to be a force in this department … He does not always work hard to get great position when the shot goes up, nor does he have the necessary frame to push opposing big men out of position … Scouts also question how much more there really is to his offensive game than just his shooting ability … He does not appear to have much of a post game, other than simple jump hooks and turnaround jumpers and is not a great finisher in traffic … Not the most vocal or demonstrative person, will need to work on being more assertive and vocal on the floor … He also is not a very gifted playmaker at this stage (1.2 assists per 40 minutes) and he goes left most times he puts the ball on the floor … He is much better attacking off the dribble from the catch than in isolation situations, and he does not look nearly as natural shooting the ball when going to his right hand … Aside from the defensive concerns, he also must develop his offensive repertoire outside of his jump shot.Versatile player who can play as a power forward and center… He has impressive mobility and coordination for a player his size… Possesses a nice physique and has added considerable muscle the last couple of years with no effect on his mobility … He runs the floor well and is actually really good in the open floor… Good inside-outside player who can mix it up on offense, although at the moment his face up game is a lot better than his back to the basket game… He can score in bunches and can “catch fire” at any time… He doesn’t force things on offense and lets the game come to him… He is already considered a great shooter from the perimeter, thanks to his great mechanics and NBA 3-point range… Very good in catch and shoot situations, especially from 45-degree angle… Plays Excellent the Pick and Pop as a screener, thanks to his great touch around the basket… Has improved on Pick and Roll Situations as the screener and has learned to cut faster to the basket after setting a screen… Has the ability to attack closeouts thanks to his explosive first step… Likes to finish strong at the basket and isn’t afraid of contact… Can put the ball on the floor and can even start the break or complete a coast to coast if the right opportunity comes up… He has even been used in Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler at times, with mixed results…  He gets at the free throw line at a high rate and he is a very good free throw shooter… Above average rebounder who rarely forgets to box out… Has good instincts on Defense, reads plays and as a result he makes a lot of steals… He has solid lateral quickness … Can defend the Pick and Roll at an acceptable rate when he is asked to hedge out… Knows the law of verticality and has good enough timing to make some blocks…","His wingspan is average and that limits him on both ends of the floor… He is a good but not an elite athlete… He needs time to gather before jumping and that could hurt him at the next level… He could add a little more weight to be able to stand the physicality of the next level… His back to the basket game isn’t completely there yet… He doesn’t always establish position in the post and has problems doing it against physical players… He could improve his ball handling to be more effective on Isolation situations… His shooting mechanics are excellent, but his shooting release is a little slow, which gives his opponents time to contest his shot… Consistency is an issue, since he still has the tendency to disappear for long stretches of games … At times he is a little passive on offense and doesn’t always ask for the ball… Just an average passer for now… Off ball Defense needs work, since at times he is too focused on the ball and loses sight of the player he is guarding… He must improve on Post Defense, learn how to use his body and not get bullied by physical players… Weak side defense is also an issue since at times he is just a step too slow to help… It’s really difficult to imagine him becoming an elite shot blocker due to his average wingspan and inability to jump high from a standing position … He has problems defending when he is asked to switch and has to guard an explosive perimeter player since his lateral quickness is just OK for now…",16.8,0.112,7.3,N

State, but he is capable of creating space, surveying the floor and passing the ball with either hand out of pick and roll situations … With better talent around him in the NBA, he will look like an even better playmaker … His open court speed makes him particularly dangerous in transition, as he will collapse the defense and find cutters or open shooters on the perimeter … He does not need a screen to collapse the defense … Instead he can usually break his man down off the dribble and get in the paint to kick out to open teammates … He also shows flashes of impressive vision and accuracy off the pick and roll … He will have a chance to be an absolute force on both ends of the court in the NBA … Has excellent size at the point guard position at 6’2 with a 6’5 wingspan … Shows a lot of confidence in his abilities and has a swagger on the floor, should not have any trouble adjusting to playing at the NBA level and be a standout PG at the next level … His upside is among the best of any player in this draft …Explosive point guard with size and great intangibles for the position … Elite level athlete and plays well above the rim.

Mitchell demonstrates tough shot-making ability, and he impresses you with his ability create space off of crossovers, step-backs, hang-dribbles, etc … He also hit a strong 81% of his free throws this past season … Probably the most appealing part of Mitchell’s game lies on the defensive end … By the end of his second year at Louisville, he established himself as a multi-positional stopper who a coach can put on point guards, shooting guards and even some small forwards … Mitchell has outstanding physical tools to be a lockdown defender, with his elite length, strong frame and quick feet … Mitchell is also a highly competitive guy who is willing to pressure full court, dive to the floor for loose balls, and consistently make things difficult for opposing players … Mitchell has terrific instincts off the ball, as shown by his 2.6 steals per-40) … Despite being short for the average two-guard, his 6’10” wingspan is difficult for opposing guards to shoot over, and he does an exemplary job of using his quickness and strength to stay in front of his man … Mitchell’s intangibles are promising as well, and he will likely give NBA teams confidence in his ability to continue improving and reach his full potential … The strides he’s made with his shooting over the past few seasons speaks volumes about his work ethic … Mitchell also is a high character kid and a well-spoken individual … He has also reportedly shined in private interviews he’s conducted in the recent past …","Mitchell is a much better leaper off of two feet than one foot, and his explosiveness on his drives diminishes when he has to elevate off of one foot, especially when forced to his weaker left hand … He also doesn’t get all the way to the rim as one might expect, as shown by his low two-point field goal percentage (46%) and below average free throw rate (4 attempts per-40), especially when operating against strong defenses … Despite a big 6’10 wingspan, his 8’1 standing reach is very small for an NBA 2-guard … Mitchell is still working on transitioning from the wing to the combo guard spot … He made strides as a playmaker in his sophomore season and operating out of the pick and roll … However, he still plays too fast at times, not always reading the defense and making the simple play … He also lacks the ideal height and court vision to see over the top of the defense, especially with bigger opponents guarding him … Even though he has improved as a shooter, Mitchell is still a streaky shooter, mostly due to his subpar shot-selection … He has a tendency to settle for tough, contested two-point jumpers, partially due to his inability to consistently get all the way to the rim, and also because of his average decision making skills … While he can make some of these attempts, it will not be a reliable way to score at the next level, and it will decrease his overall offensive efficiency, as it has in college …",19.6,0.129,18.2,N

Enjoys being on the court with his team …","One of the biggest concerns right now for Ferguson, as mentioned earlier, is his lack of an ideal frame … He checked in at the Combine at just 184 pounds, which causes him to struggle containing bigger guards … He also can get pushed out of position pretty easily and get caught on screens … This also causes him to get pushed out of his spots on offense, as he often is not able to get all the way to the rim without an open lane … Against bigger guards and wings, he allows his man to go right through him most times without showing much resistance … He also can be too upright, which somewhat mitigates his lateral quickness and athleticism … Even though he is competitive with big men down low on switches, he is too thin to be a true threat when defending them … On offense he is easily knocked off balance when going to the basket, and he shies away from contact, limiting his size advantage … Ferguson also rarely gets to the free-throw line (2.2 FTA per 40 minutes), and he still needs to refine his in between game to become a better all-around offensive threat … His ball handling skills are very limited, and he struggles to create space, especially against better defenders … Right now he is limited to mostly catch and shoot offense and straight line drives … He also has much room for improvement as a passer and initiating offense, as he turns the ball over much more frequently than he registers assists … As common for a young player, his feel for the game and instincts on both ends are just average … He averaged just 0.4 steals and 0.7 blocks per 40 minutes, which are numbers that should probably be much higher given his tools … He tends to get lost off the ball on defense, and tends to force a lot of passes as well instead of making the simple play … As a shooter Ferguson must become more consistent … This will probably determine if he becomes a solid contributor in the NBA … With his other limitations, he must be able to knock down perimeter shots consistently … He sometimes shoots on the way down, despite his excellent elevation on his jump shot, and he is a relatively poor free throw shooter (58.3%) …Although he has incredible athleticism, he rarely shows it in a game especially in a half court set. Needs to get a lot stronger to make plays through contact … Lacks much in the way of a midrange game … Needs to improve as a ball handler and his playmaking ability … Doesn’t have much wiggle or creativity on offense … He’s a straight line driver and doesn’t break down the defense … Doesn’t have a wide variety to his scoring arsenal … Doesn’t provide much offensively if his shot isn’t falling … He plays well within the offense, but isn’t the type to put the team on his back and score in bunches in times of desperation … Can be passive at times.

Standing 6’10.5’’ in shoes, possessing an elite 7’5.5’’ wingspan, and a 9’2.5’’ standing reach, Allen’s ability to haul in rebounds will be one of his calling cards in the NBA … Through 22 games into his college career, Allen is pulling in a very respectable 8.4 rebounds per game, which includes a 2.9 split for offensive boards … His length, really allows him to get well above the rim with minimal effort … He’s also turned up his productivity during conference play, as he adjusts further to the NCAA game … Through 8 Big 12 games, Jarrett is pulling down 11 rebounds per game, which also included 3 straight double doubles in early Jan. Allen’s length will also allow him to protect the rim at the next level … He’s not an elite shot blocker, although good (1.6 bpg), but as he adds weight and experience, he has the ability to become a deterrent in the paint in the NBA … His immense length makes up for some deficiencies moving laterally, and he’s shown the ability to hedge successfully while defending pick and roll situations … Due to Shaquille Cleare playing the center for the Longhorns, Allen has actually played this season at the 4 spot for Shaka Smart … Allen’s ability to shoot in the mid range allows this, and it’s a nice piece of his offensive game when looking towards the NBA … Jarrett has a nice touch out to 12 feet, and good hands that allow him to catch passes around the rim, and finish at a good clip (68% at the rim according to hoop-math.com) … This foundation at such a young age make it reasonable to project him as being a player in the pick and pop game, as well as a solid roll man … His FT percentage is just 60%, but again, as he’s gained confidence throughout the season, he’s seen this element of his game improve. During Big 12 play, Allen is shooting 75% on a pretty decent 4.5 attempts per game. I wouldn’t go as far to say Jarrett projects as a high level offensive talent in the NBA, but his shooting touch gives him far more potential than many bigs his size who rely on athleticism alone to get buckets … Allen is a pretty good athlete as well … He’s a fast player for being near 7 feet tall, and is already 235 pounds.

He does an excellent job of spotting up in transition as he has a knack for finding open spaces on the court to get his shot off, where he has deep range that should translate to the NBA arc … He gets his feet set quickly as well, and his mechanics stay consistent with a hand in his face … Dorsey also does a great job of running off screens to get his shot off and looks very comfortable shooting on the move … Off the pick and roll he consistently demonstrated the ability to make defenders pay for going under the ball screen with his pull up jumper … One also has to appreciate that he never loses confidence in his shot and that he does not need much space at all to get it off … At the rim, he uses a lot of shot fakes and has excellent footwork to get his shot off, or draw contact and get to the free throw line (75% conversion rate) … It is primarily Dorsey’s shot making and ability to get hot in a hurry that gives him great potential as a role player in the NBA … With NBA spacing he could thrive as a shot maker and secondary ball handler off the bench. Dorsey is not a true floor general, but he did play a lot of point guard for Oregon, so he has experience running an offense … He is also improving as a playmaker, as he has decent vision and does not turn the ball over that frequently … He operates well out of the pick and roll and has shown flashes of making good reads to set up his teammates … Dorsey particularly showed during the NCAA Tournament that he is unusually poised in big moments and that he can be depended on to make big plays when it counts … Any potential playoff team that may draft him would really appreciate the mental aspect of his game … If Dorsey can prove that the NCAA Tournament was not a fluke and that he is really beginning to put it all together, he could carve out a nice career for himself.","The most concerning aspect of Dorsey’s game is his less than impressive physical tools for an NBA two-guard … He checked in at the NBA Combine at 6-4.5 with an even more underwhelming 6-5 wingspan … He also weighs just 183 pounds, so he may struggle to get to the rim and finish against bigger, physical guards … This will likely prevent him from being a multi-positional defender at the next level … His lack of length will limit his effectiveness to guard on the perimeter and be active in passing lanes … He has already shown limitations in this area, averaging just 1.1 steals per 40 minutes in two seasons at Oregon … With his physical profile, he is probably best suited to guard point guards, but he may not be quick enough to do so given how explosive modern-day NBA point guards are … Dorsey also does not show a great deal of competitiveness on this end of the court either … When switched onto bigger players he does not battle for position persistently … He also tends to have some frequent lapses off the ball, losing shooters on the wings or giving up easy backdoor cuts. Dorsey does not project as an advanced shot creator at the NBA level either. Given his average explosiveness and shiftiness with the ball, he can get forced into some difficult shots, and he will probably have trouble finishing around the rim against NBA length/athleticism. Much of his shot selection comes via difficult contested shots given his lack of creativity with the ball and his less than ideal physical tools. He can be out of control going to the rim as well and force a lot of wild shots at the basket instead of looking to make a play for someone else. Dorsey is not a very willing passer either, which can cause him to be inefficient at times. It appears that the majority of his NBA impact will be contingent on his shot making ability. However, if he can’t get hot from the outside, NBA teams might worry if there is anything else he can bring to the table.",10.7,0.031,-0.5,Y

After raising eyebrows as a freshman, Bryant didn’t have as spectacular of a sophomore season at Indiana.

very good for a guy his size, with some crossovers and behind the back dribbles and can even start the fast break as the ball handler … He can change speed and pace like a wing when he has the ball in his hands … He has even been used as the ball handler in Pick-n-Roll situations due to his great ball handling and passing ability … Probaly the best frontcourt passer of his generation … Has great court vision and can see angles that a few players can when he is double teamed … Can pass either on the move or while standing … Very good passer on high-low situations … Can start the break after he takes the defensive rebound with great outlet passes, which can make with either hand … Goes to the line a lot, since he has the ability to draw a lot of fouls … He is a very good rebounder at youth level, with great rebounding instincts… Like on offense, he is not afraid to bang bodies in the post on Defense too… Solid shot blocker … Fills the lanes on Defense at a good rate when he is concentrated … His lateral quickness isn’t bad and has the potential to become good defender on Pick-n-Roll situations …","Very emotional player, who at time lets his emotions distract him … His attitude and body language on the court make him look a little cocky, or immature … He is just an above average athlete  … Jumps almost exclusively off two feet and needs some time to gather before he does, which will probably be a problem at the next level … Has incisostent shooting mechanics, since he changes his release point when he is closely guarded … Seems to have problems finishing in the paint against physical opponents, with the main problem being that he doesn’t always go strong to the basket and settles for floaters and finesse moves … Misses a lot of easy lay ups, which is something you don’t expect from someone with his talent … He may have the ability to become a great stretch-big in the future, but he can’t do this at a consistent level yet due to his incosistent shooting … Has to improve his free throw percentage, which for now is in the 65-72% rate … He is out of control with the ball in his hand at times, trying to do too much … Turnover prone, mainly because he either looks for the flashy move rather than just making the right play, or because he has the tendency to telegraph his passes… He loses his concentration on Defense and forgets assignments … Has problems defending the Pick-n-Roll, because he often either over commits to the ball handler or leaves after the player he is guarding sets the pick … Gets in foul trouble too often … He doesn’t have the length or the athletic ability to be considered an elite rim protector … He doesn’t know the law of verticality on defense just yet, which is something that could help him … Has a tendency to put his hands down when he tries to block a shot and he is whisted for a lot of fouls because of it … It’s questionable whether he will be able to guard athletic stretch power forwards at the next level…for as good as he is he wasn’t able to lead a good German team to the victory in last EuroU16 … It’s not a big deal but so far he looks a little more to shine for himself than helping his team winning … We are obviously talking about an elite young player, but he lacks consistency within games, where it is common place for him to do a couple of amazing plays and then disappear for a while … If he can develop the killer mentality, he should be dominant … His decision making is questionable, he doesn;t always make the best decision, but often gets away with it because he is way more athletic and stronger than everybody else, but these types of plays will not work in the future … His shot is good but needs more consistency (though he is getting a lot better

combination of physical tools along with some very good open court speed … Possesses very solid run/jump athleticism, and appears that he will hold his own against NBA athleticism after registering a 38-inch max vertical leap at the NBA Combine … Dotson’s best attribute, which will likely be his NBA calling card, is his catch and shoot ability … He can be lethal spotting up on the perimeter or

per-40 minutes … Continuing to develop his playmaking could make him a really valuable backcourt player if his jump shot turns out to be as prolific in the NBA as it was this past season … Dotson is a physical on-ball defender, which could provoke some three-and-D potential … He does a nice job of sliding his feet to contain dribble penetration, and he can force challenging shots with his length …

He attempted just eight jump shots on the season, and looked very mechanical when doing so … There isn’t a whole lot of fluidity in his jump shot, and his 53.5% shooting from the free-throw line suggests that he does not have great upside as a stretch forward … Anigbogu is similarly unrefined in the post … Despite his size and strength, he shot just 30.4% on post-up opportunities, despite using a sizable portion of his half-court offense on the block … His lack of touch again comes into play here, but his unrefined footwork is a big factor in his ineffectiveness as well … Anigbogu can become predictable in the post, as he is limited to mostly simple jump hooks and turnarounds … His hands are not secure and he fumbles away far too many easy catches and rebounds … He also becomes very turnover prone when doubled in the post, turning the ball over on nearly 18% of his post-up possessions, which is nearly as often as the 25% at which he scores … Another issue he has is that he can be too aggressive in seeking out opportunities to block shots … Anigbogu has a tendency to find himself out of position as he chases shots he has little to no chance of getting to … While his constant motor and activity level are things to be valued, he’ll have to work on harnessing his aggression and continue to develop his overall recognition, awareness, and communication defensively in order to make the most of his physical gifts … His 7.6 fouls for per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, say a lot about his lack of defensive discipline … Even though it takes six fouls in the NBA before disqualification, he will need to improve in this area to stay on the court for longer stretches … One more area he could improve on is on the defensive glass, as he hauled in just 19.9% of the available defensive rebounds while he was on the court … His activity as a shot blocker hinders him somewhat in this regard, but his overall awareness can get better … He is capable of rebounding out of his area because of his physical tools, but he needs to do a better job of being in position to haul in defensive rebounds …",17.0,0.057,0.0,Y

Further honing his 3 point shot to become a 40+% shooter would also help his cause, this is very do-able because of his good mechanics … Since he most likely won’t be hanging his hat on the defensive end, he’ll need to up his game … He’ll turn 23 before his first NBA game, so he’ll need to figure out his NBA niche fairly quick or risk teams giving that roster spot to a guy they feel has a higher ceiling …",15.1,0.124,5.3,N

448,"When comparted to other 6’9’’ players, Diallo has both terrific end to end speed, and a motor to keep him going. His stride is both effortless, and his constant effort re-affirms all the ravings about his motor dating back to his high school days. These traits make Diallo a transition threat as a big man, and also aid him as a chase down shot blocker in the open court. Cheick also has good length. Sporting a 7’4’’ wingspan and a 9’1’’ standing reach (according to the 2015 Hoop Summit) he sizes up pretty favorably for an NBA 4 man. While probably not an elite leaper, he gets off the ground very quickly, and is easily a good jumper for a 6’9’’ player. Transitioning his length and athletic ability to the NBA should not be an issue with continued physical maturity. He has great timing as a shot blocker, especially from the weak side. Despite limited minutes as a freshman, Diallo blocked 4.2 shots per game per 40 minutes, and actually would have done so without projecting to foul out (3.7 fouls per 40 minutes). He possesses a knack for rebounding the ball despite not always being in the best position. Cheick’s per 40 minute rebound numbers would come right in at 13.3 per game. His long arms, really aid in his ability to grab misses on the defensive end. He also showed the ability to finish strong around the hoop, and good hands catching alley oops. It should also be noted that despite a season in which he probably tallied a lot fewer minutes than he expected, Cheick was an engaged player off the bench, and showed positive body language and overall team support when his minutes began to fade during Big 12 play.The 6’9 big man from Mali is known for his high energy and nonstop motor.

His usage percentage was 21.7% was 2nd only on the team to Perry Ellis’ 25.5% and Diallo only dished out 1 assist on the season to pair with 17 turnovers. Despite sporting a good overall FG% (54.7%) his shot selection showed he had little grasp of the flow of the game, and good ball movement. He was also prone to lazy passes due to lack of adjustment to the offensive speed of college basketball. He can hit a 15 footer at a decent clip, which is a positive sign for his shot development, but he’s got a bit of a hitch in his shot movement that would benefit him if he corrected. Diallo must also continue to hit the weights, he’s not ready for a major NBA role next season, but has a nice frame to add muscle.

He can also help the guards bringing the ball up and has strong IQ and good decision making … Intangibles are where he separates himself from the herd, a sharp, focused kid who understand his role and wants to win, which is what everybody looks for in the league … Doesn’t have the length of Leonard or his offensive skills, but the right attitude will help him have a better career than more talented players …","A little inconsistent on both ends of the floor this past season … Needs to improve his ability to directly finish as the rim … Better leaper off of two feet than one. Not incredibly explosive, just solid leaping ability … Has nice touch overall, but not against length … Doesn’t go up as strong versus longer players … Does not finish as well against contact as his strength may make you think … Is often out of control when driving to the rim … Sometimes settles for floaters too often … Needs to prove he can make his teammates better … Struggles with making decisions (setting up teammates) when he’s attacking the basket in transition … Sometimes has tunnel vision when he’s on the move on offense and does not look to pass to his teammates … Missed a lot of open teammates … Not an accurate passer … Needs to develop his left hand more (finishing and ball-handling) … Often relies too much on overpowering and going through defenders on the dribble drive … Forgets about his teammates at times because he tries to prove himself as a scorer … Play more below the rim in half court settings … Struggles at times to create for himself against quick defenders … Fails to create separation in isolation situations … Gets too caught up in creating contact that it takes his focus off getting to the rim and finishing … This also gets him called for a lot of charges … Struggled with shot selection … Tends to push the ball even when there’s no numbers … Needs to pick his spots better … Forces bad shots in the paint against multiple defenders … Short arms his shots … Streaky shooter … Needs to develop a more consistent jumper from mid-range and the 3-point line … Jump shot has a flat/low release … Shoots contested jumpers early in the clock … A little turnover prone … Effort level on defense fluctuates at times … Needs to be consistently locked in on defense instead of just in flashes (has lapses) … Although he can recover well, he gets beat off the dribble from the perimeter … Either loses his man or overhelps … Gets caught ball watching … Slow in his recognition of screens at times … Lets his aggressiveness get the best of him … Good rebounder but sometimes fails to put his body on a man and box out …The offensive side has to become better for him to become an impact player on both ends … his biggest issue right now is his jump shot … Not that he doesn’t score, he actually shoots pretty well for his form … The problem is that right now his shot is very flat and the release point is in front of the face which doesn’t allow him to be consistent, particular when tired or under pressure from a contest … In high school, many players contesting his shot are smaller than him, but in the league he will go against elite athletes that will obscure his vision … Just a small change rising his release point 6-12 inches will have a great impact on his percentages … Definitely something they will work with him on at Arizona next year … Becoming a reliable 3 point shooter could make the difference in his career … My other big concern is that he could have a Trevor Ariza kind of moment, deciding to be the best or second best player in the team where he will struggle a lot … As long as he stays in his role (3rd or 4th option and dirty work) he can be absolutely be among the best at it … His athleticism is cause of concern because he really struggles jumping off of two feet (needing momentum)  and this really hurts him on rebounds where he has to work twice as hard … Despite those weakness I really believe Stanley intangibles will give him a chance to be a valuable NBA contributor …",9.2,0.037,-1.6,N
484,"At 7-feet, there not many players around with his offensive skill set …. Highly fundamental, Kaminsky has great footwork, can go left and right and does a great job of using his length on offense … He can finish at the rim with either hand, post up on either block, shoot from the mid-range, consistently knock down 3’s and even attack you from off the dribble … The lack of quickness and explosiveness is compensated by his high basketball IQ … He is able to go by defenders on close outs, controlling his body to avoid charges, but also to basically post up from 16/15 feet and slowly back down defenders to the basket … His shooting touch is what is really intriguing about him … He didn’t shoot particularly well in the summer camps (adidas Nations) but he has been very consistent during this first part of the season, so far, even from long range, though he needs to get his feet set to be effective … He is a scoring threat from everywhere on the court … He loves utilizing his spin move, going back to the middle of the floor, and knows how to use it to be aggressive and shoot over his defender in a similar way of what Dirk does at the NBA level … Perhaps an area where he is a little underrated is passing, he has great vision of the court and makes really good decision with the ball, at his height he can see the floor really well and that can help in high-low situations, for example … A perfect guy to play pick and pop, very hard to ICE on ball screens, he spaces the floor well and he is also effective in the post … In the NBA, he will have to be a 4 offensively, and life will not be as easy to get by opponents, he will need to be a professor and learn all thr tricks with angles and fakes in order to not be neutralized by his lack of athleticism … Despite that he is 7-foot and able to contest shots in the paint, the long arms help him get many rebounds, but he will have to add strength to hold off NBA players while boxing them out …  20 years ago his size would probably have made him more appealing, in today quick, athletic game he will have to find the right system in order to show all of his skills offensively … He also possesses a high character with a lot of personality and confidence …","The most obvious one is his subpar level of athleticism and lateral movement, but one of the main concerns with him ironically is on offense … It’s possible to find a role for him defensively where he won’t be exploited, he has length after all,  but will he be able to succeed in an offensive system different from the one he thrives in at Wisconsin? The fact that he struggled so mightily in the wide open format in front of so many scouts at adidas Nations in the summer has to be a conern … Theoretically he is the perfect guy to play in the triangle offense,  in a way that maybe only Pau Gasol did, and certainly he could find his place an offense like the Spurs (every high IQ player could) … But could he survive in more ISO oriented offenses where he will not have the ball in his hands much? A lot will depend on his consistency shooting, the percentages show us he is improving but the NBA 3 pointer is a different animal and though the high release will help Kaminsky a lot in shooting over people, his release is pretty slow and could be a problem … The talent is there but he has to show he can use it at the next level, and his limited upside (because he is already almost at the top of his game) and older age might scare some team away (Tyler Zeller was a much better/faster athlete and he fell to 20 as a senior, and has been traded)… Another big question mark is how will he deal with NBA physicality on both ends of the floor … He could potentially guard 5s but only if he adds strength to his body, while the 4 position could be too fast and explosive for him … And on offense people may push him out of the blocks too easily … The fact that he didn;t really do anything in his first two seasons in college is also a slight concern. Is he just a late bloomer, or is he taking advantage of players younger than himself as an upperclassman? … All that being said, we are talking about a player with a rare set of skills, who in the right system could utilize his abilities and become a great role player …",14.2,0.094,3.7,N

Even blocks some shots, making use of his great quickness and timing … Has done a solid job of avoiding turnovers and making solid decisions with the ball, as evidenced by his positive a/to ratio … Comfortable handling the ball on the break … Has exhibited a nice ability to create off the dribble from the perimeter and get to the rim and finish … Also has good body control and touch on the move. His ability to convert plays while operating at such a high rate of speed is very intriguing … Smart kid and considered a high character individual …","Throughout his high school and AAU career he flashed tremendous talent but struggled to sustain a high level of consistency … Can lose focus at times during games, but has been a lot more consistent and prepared then expected … He needs to continue to show a high level of aggression and intensity in order to realize his immense talent … Shot shows high potential but still has some minor kinks in his mechanics that need to be ironed out in order to add range and consistency … Should look to improve upon his current 62% FT shooting …",10.3,0.044,-0.3,N

In only 21 minutes per game, he’s leading the Big 12 in blocked shots (2.7 per game) and has emerged as a terror on the help side. He shows excellent timing and instincts to block shots, and gets off the ground quickly despite his lack of great fluidity … Also, with a reported 9’1.5"" standing reach, he has the length to contest shots 1 on 1 at the NCAA and NBA level, and while his current weight isn’t conducive to pushing around NBA big men, 240 pounds is considerably larger than many young forwards have come into the league at since the 1 and done rule was implemented … Turner even shows surprising passing and decision making with a 1:1 a/to ratio, unusual for a freshman big … Scores very highly in the character and communication department. Seems wise beyond his years and should have no trouble adapting to the NBA game and staying focused …   Weaknesses: Lacks fluidity, certainly he’s a guy who is mobile and can run the court, but his athleticism isn’t something that jumps out when you watch him … He has had some difficulties with his hips related to growth. His legs appear to be extremely stiff to the point where it appears he runs with a slight limp. Time will tell whether this is a temporary thing or he will always be a player lacking fluidity … Since he is so young, he could be one of those players who could improve his athletic ability, and flexibility with continued weight training … His lower body strength is probably of the most concern right now, as he can be pushed off the block and out of position by older, more physical NCAA players … While he’s definitely held his own in some bigger games this year, when matched against players his own size or larger from a bulk standpoint, he’s yet to really excel. In 5 games against major conference opponents, Myles has averaged 6.4 points, 6 rebounds, and 2 blocks per game which is big drop off when compared to 14.75 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.1 blocks per game against smaller mid major schools … There’s a lot to like about Turner, but his stats will need to be a little more reliable as he enters Big 12 play and doesn’t have the luxury of beating up on smaller schools who can’t match his size …"," Lacks fluidity, certainly he’s a guy who is mobile and can run the court, but his athleticism isn’t something that jumps out when you watch him … He has had some difficulties with his hips related to growth.

Rarely fails to ""show up"" for games … Moves around the court well with or without the ball … Good overall shot-selection … Hard worker, who appears to respect the game … Has good size for a small forward (measured recently at 6’8.5"" in shoes), and still has some time to grow … Appears to have a wingspan of 7’0"" or close to it … He makes up for his lack of elite athleticism by being an aggressive athlete that takes advantage of any opportunities the defense gives to him … Has shown the ability to rise up and emphatically dunk over the top of the defense … Footspeed is fairly average, but he’s still a very fluid runner, particularly in the open court … Knows how to take advantage of ""sleeping"" defenders, showing great activity off the ball with an understanding of back-cuts and spotting-up from the corner … Is a pure shooter that displays a soft touch out to the NBA three-point line … Has the size, touch and footwork to become a very capable player in the post, which would make him a big-time mismatch threat from the wing position … Capable in the mid-range with a rapidly improving pull-up jumper that is already extremely difficult to defend … Dangerous when taking players off the dribble … Uses hesitations, fakes and crossovers to throw his defender off balance … Combines a refined offensive awareness with an unselfish nature to always find his teammates when they are open … Solid defender that works hard to bother his man … Has the length and instincts to make an impact on the glass as well … High-character player and a member of the LDS church … Still very young and has a lot of room to improve … Likely the top high school player in the country and has superstar potential …","Defense and position are the two biggest questions with Parker … Some wonder whether he is quick enough to guard on the perimeter, or if he is long enough to defend the post … Has been given the ""tweener"" label that no draft prospect wants associated with his name … Appears to carry some extra ""baby fat"" … Somewhat slow release on the jumper, and it has a hitch; may need to tweak release to improve scoring opportunities against athletic defenders who match his size … Can he expand his range to be a reliable 3-point shooter? … Was asked to play in the post defensively for Duke, which may lead to an even bigger learning curve for Parker as he improves his understanding of how to guard wings in the NBA … Not a particularly crafty defender; surprising given how intelligent an offensive player he is …Defense is the area of his game that has drawn the greatest amount of criticism. Does not exhibit the same level of intensity and effort on that end, and how much of that was due to playing center or staying out of foul trouble is open to debate … Given his size, there are some concerns about him being in between the SF and PF positions at the next level … Also, will need to find a weight that will allow him to maximize his athleticism … Not really a defined or “tight-skinned” specimen physically, and probably carried slightly more weight than he should’ve last season … Appears to be a guy that will always have to work a little harder to keep his weight in check, and his body toned. And any extended injuries could cause him more trouble weight wise than the average prospect. But he seems up to the task … Not a sharp team defender yet, and still needs to improve his knowledge of where to be on this side of the ball … Makes fundamental errors, and can look lost when defending the pick and roll game, and was at times exposed for this against quality opponents who spaced the floor on offense last season … Needs to work on improving his lateral speed and defensive technique … Effort overall on defense needs improvement as well … Sometimes settles for more difficult looks than he should, and doesn’t always look to get to the rim as much as he should … Can make tough shots, but does shoot more contested jumpers than he has to … Sometimes tries to be too aggressive, especially when his team was trailing … Not quite an overly explosive athlete, and can struggle at times to finish above taller defenders when he can’t get a clean drive past the initial defense … Has high level talent, but needs to polish his skills and do a better job with his shot selection to really reach his potential as a player …While Parker is a good all-around athlete, he won’t be much of a stand-out as far as the NBA is concerned … His first-step lacks the explosion of some of the other elite-level prospects he’s often compared to, and he won’t be labeled by many as a ""high flyer"" either … If he works hard on his strength and conditioning, he should be able to maximize his potential athletically as he grows into his height, but even for a player with a reputation like Parker, this is still an “if” … Parker’s outside shot can be inconsistent, though at only 16 years of age, this is a common issue, and can be rectified with practice and experience … He’s drawn comparisons to players like Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony, and those kinds of expectations can weigh heavily on younger players …",16.3,0.078,2.5,N
538,"The sculpted Embiid has a prototypical body for an NBA center, standing 7 feet tall, with a 7.5-foot reach, and weighing 250 pounds. He could use more muscle, but his frame should have no trouble bearing the additional bulk … Posted outstanding per-40-minutes numbers in his lone season at Kansas, averaging 19.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 4.5 blocks … An agile and mobile center, with nimble feet, good speed, great quickness, and vertical explosiveness … Excellent around the rim, scoring regularly on put-backs and alley opps.  According to Hoop-Math.com, Embiid made 76.3 percent of his attempts at the rim this past season…  His offensive game is still a work in progress, but the potential is there.  His offensive arsenal includes very quick drop-steps, jump hooks, and turn-around jumpers … Uses a variety of ball and body fakes to create space for his shot, including the renowned “Dream Shake.” … Draws a bunch of fouls (8.8 per 40 minutes), and makes a respectable 69 percent of his free-throw attempts … An active and aggressive weak-side defender …  Covers a lot of ground with his length and huge strides … Stats don’t tell the full story – on the defensive end, he alters a number of shots and is generally disruptive … Not timid – willing to put a body on someone and mix it up in the paint …  Sets solid screens … Doesn’t panic when double teamed …    Weaknesses:  Embiid had trouble staying on the floor, either due to injuries or foul trouble.  In a total of 28 games at KU, he played fewer than 20 minutes 10 times and more than 30 minutes only three times … Questionable durability – this past season, he missed one game (Feb. 15) due to a knee injury, played in the four following games, and then was shut down for the rest of the year due to a stress fracture in his lower back. He also dealt with lower back issues as a senior in high school … Averaged a whopping 5.9 fouls per 40 minutes at KU … Lacks both offensive and defensive awareness … Averaged 4.2 turnovers per 40 minutes at KU …  Defensively, he frequently focuses too much on the ball and loses track of his man … Was at times pushed off the block by bigger centers … Seems to get frustrated when not heavily involved in the offense or not making his shots.  At those times, his play appears to be a bit lackadaisical …   Notes:  Was named to the 2013-14 Associated Press All-America Second Team and also named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year … Set the KU freshman record with 72 blocked shots. Also set KU freshman records in field goal percentage (62.6) and rebounds per game (8.1) … Finished second in the Big 12 in blocks (2.6 per game) and sixth in rebounds per game … Was not tested much in the undersized Big 12 conference, and when he was, the results were relatively subpar.  In a total of five games vs. the big front lines of Texas, Baylor and New Mexico, plus one game against the muscular Patrick Young and Florida, Embiid shot 50 percent from the field and averaged 10.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.8 blocks, and 24 minutes per game … Began playing basketball at one of Luc Richard Mbah a Moute’s basketball camps in Cameroon when he was 16 years old …  Speaks three languages: English, French, and Bassa (the native language of Cameroon)…   Outlook: The optimist looks at Embiid and thinks of his outstanding per-40 stats, while the pessimist thinks about the fact that he missed 20 percent of Jayhawks’ games and averaged less the 24 minutes per outing when he was out there. The optimist thinks about Embiid’s skill level despite his lack of experience and drools over what he could become in 3-4 years, while the pessimist worries that Embiid has just as much of a chance to become the next Greg Oden as he does the next Hakeem Olajuwon … Almost no one expects Embiid to fall further than third overall in the draft.  Exactly where he is selected will come down to his private workouts and medical examinations. He worked out for Cleveland last week, and the subsequent media reports were conflicting to say the least. It is fairly safe to say that the Cavs didn’t promise to take Embiid with the first overall selection because he is headed to Milwaukee later this week … As for the Sixers, who hold the third overall pick, Embiid is not currently to scheduled to meet with them, or if he is, it has not yet been reported …A seven footer with an exceptionally high ceiling…  What is most striking about Embiid is how advanced his game is given that he reportedly only started playing basketball in 2011. The former volleyball and soccer player is clearly a naturally gifted athlete, and his length and fluidity both translate very well to basketball…  He keeps good balance offensively both with his back to the basket and, more impressively, facing the hoop…  His body control and lateral movement for a seven footer are both exceptional…  Although his leaping ability is somewhat average, Embiid is able to dunk the ball between his legs with ease — a testament to his body control and good hands… Offensively, Embiid’s game is quickly expanding, but he can already score in a variety of ways.  Going forward, he will likely rely on mid-range jumpers and back to the basket post moves.  However, he is already confident taking face up shots out to the college three point line with decent (but not great) form.  While at Kansas it will be interesting to see if Bill Self expands on this aspect of his game or (more likely) asks him to be strictly an interior presence…  Embiid’s post game is a work in progress, but he does show the ability to take short jump hooks off of a clean drop step with good balance…  Embiid possesses very good hands and a soft touch, both on the catch and his shot…  He is a willing passer — he mentioned in an interview with a Kansas recruiting site that he believes passing is a strength to his game.","As with most high school seven footers, there is plenty for Embiid to work on…  Embiid’s moves are fluid, but can be slow, especially vertically.  He is not an especially quick leaper, and spends a long time gathering himself before jumping… Embiid could use some work keeping the ball high in the post, and keeping his hands high in general, especially for shot blocking and rebounding purposes — not especially difficult to do, just takes practice… Should polish his back-to-the-basket moves…  His frame is very good for a 17 year old, but he will need to continue to work on his body and strength to compete physically in the post at the next level…  You would like to see him develop more of a ""beast mode,"" or nasty streak, as many great centers have…  He reportedly averaged only 1.9 blocks per game his senior season at the Rock School in Gainesville, Florida, which is difficult to imagine given his great length and athleticism.  He should pursue shot blocking opportunities more actively, as well as improve his timing… To this same point, Embiid should focus on being very loud defensively and becoming an ""anchor"" a la Kevin Garnet, Tyson Chandler, and other impact defensive bigs.  He is in a unique position where he possesses the physical tools to do so.",27.9,0.215,26.8,N

Capable of playing an entire HS game and barely appears winded … Well spoken kid who seems to have a solid understanding of what he does well and plays to his strengths … Does a solid job of forcing the issue and drawing contact to get to the line … Has some back to the basket skills with the ability to gain position on the block and create a wide target and overpower opponents, outclassing them with his great size, strength and athleticism … Shows some ability to handle the ball in the open floor and has decent speed when he gets a head of steam …","Gordon’s main weaknesses revolve around his lacking skill level on the offensive side of the ball …Despite being the 2nd leading scorer on an Arizona squad that almost made it to the Final 4, Gordon needs extensive improvement offensively … His ball-handling ability is not very good right now, and he loses significant effectiveness the more he dribbles the ball … Rarely looks comfortable with his back to the rim … Not blessed with a soft touch, which suggests he will continue to have his struggles as a jump shooter, and from the line … Doesn’t seem to have a lot of range on his shot, even though he can occasionally hit 22 footers … Struggled mightily at the foul line in his only year in school (42%) and needs to work on his form, develop a little more sense of urgency and develop a set routine which replicates his mid range shot, and eliminates the ""long pause"" … Has a very deliberate and slow shot, sometimes it looks like the ball barely rotates when he shoots … Physically, Gordon has adequate height and strength, but he could use a little more bulk to his frame … Could get sealed by bigger PF’s in the NBA due to his narrow frame … Not particularly lengthy … Some consider Gordon a bit of a tweener, it will be interesting to see what type of body weight he can ultimately carry comfortably … Was determined to show that he was a small forward, but scouts view him strictly as a 4 for the next level … Needs to work on his footwork, as he picks up traveling calls often when trying to create … Has high/tight hips and it sometimes shows in his lateral movements … Has a very awkward running style, and while some compare it to Rodman with the way he runs on his toes, Gordon’s extremely short stride has drawn some concerns … Though very good on the offensive glass, Gordon sometimes shows raw awareness on the defensive glass and will forget to box out or be in the wrong places when the ball has been shot …His game shows a lot of potential, but he’s far from a finished product … His shooting ability is troublesome. He shoots roughly 50% from the FT line and has no consistency outside of the paint … Tweener. Doesn’t have a well defined NBA position at this point. While he has tremendous explosiveness, he lacks perimeter skills (shooting, passing) and great foot speed. Lack of foot speed hurts him on both ends of the floor as it limits his on ball perimeter defensive efficiency as well as his ability to get by opponents off the dribble … Foot work is not very good for a high level athlete … While he is an elite athlete, his general quickness is not at an elite level … Shows some developed ball handling ability but his lack of foot speed negates that ability to some degree. He gets nearly all of his points playing as a 4, and there are major questions about his ability to create offense for himself facing the basket. Granted, he’s by far the tallest player on his high school team, so playing anything other than center is irrational from a team standpoint … Plays too upright defensively. Looks a little stiff in his movements. While his physical strength is good, he appears to lack some flexibility in his body. Ankles and hips lack fluidity as he appears to run and move more like a 4 than a 3 … Has been called ""California soft"" by some observers, but to his credit doesn’t shy away from contact.

He has not proven himself against a high enough level of competition to make anyone feel completely comfortable drafting him in the top 5 … Some of his best performances have come in games (Under 19 World Championships) where he appeared to be one of the most physically advanced players … Playing for the Australian National Team, he was given free reign to create offense for himself. Can he be as succesful without being given the same level of freedom? … Exum has played off the ball a lot, and he doesn’t appear ready to be a true point guard … His handle is loose at times – has the ball poked away too often and occasionally fumbles when changing hands or directions … Not an exceptional facilitator – makes too many ill-advised passes … Inconsistent outside shot – does not always get enough elevation and has a low release point, especially when his feet are set (catch-and-shoot) …  Trajectory on his shot appears flat at times … Settles for long-distance threes too often … Not vertically explosive and struggles to finish with authority.

improving in these areas this offseason.  His explosiveness, both vertically and horizontally, could simply be improved by continuing to increase his conditioning and by adding more muscle.  To become an outstanding offensive player, he also needs to tighten his handle, make better decisions, and improve his shooting consistency beyond 15 feet … On the other end of the floor, it’s unlikely that he will ever play at an elite level – he’s not tall enough to consistently defend pro centers, and he’s not quick enough to reliably stay with agile power forwards on the perimeter … O’Bryant appears to

Good body control and great touch on his floaters … Uses nifty hop and Euro steps to get to the rim…  Draws a bunch of fouls, averaging 9 FTA per 40 over his last two seasons at CU … Excellent free-throw shooter, making better than 81 percent of his attempts in each of his three seasons at CU … Solid three-point shooter, making more than 41 percent of his attempts in two of his three seasons with the Buffalos … Very effective scoring and finding open perimeter shooters when driving off the pick and roll … Tallest player classified as a point guard at the combine – his height allows him to shoot unimpeded and easily find open teammates … Makes crisp interior passes … Good off-the-ball defense – denies very well … Fast – gets down the floor quickly and can stick with talented scorers, such as Marcus Smart and Andrew Wiggins, on defense … High character guy with good intelligence. Seemingly a good teammate – enthusiastic, likable, expressive, involved, and shares the ball …   Weaknesses: Dinwiddie’s most glaring weakness is his lack of assertiveness and consistency. Scouts often wonder why his level of intensity is not at the same level at all time. Should look to be a little more selfish (assertive). Has standout ability but doesn’t always take it upon himself to be the star that he should be … Still recovering from a torn ACL that he suffered in January …  Questionable whether he is a true point guard or more a combo –  frequently played off the ball at CU, though excels in ball handling and passing … Slender build – bounces off stronger players on both ends of the floor … Avoids contact when driving – prefers to pull up or pass out rather than go all the way to the hole … Limited dribble moves … Doesn’t show much ability to create his own shot, frequently relying of screens to get open … Too dependent on his right hand – shoots with his right on drives to the left side of the rim…  Easily picked off by screens on the defensive side of the ball, which is seemingly due to a combination of a lack of awareness and strength …   Notes:  At the time of Dinwiddie’s knee injury, CU was 14-2 and ranked 15th in the country. At the time, he was averaging 14.7 points and 3.8 assists per game and shooting 46.6 percent from the field and 41.3 percent from the 3-point line … Without him, the Buffalos were a sub-500 team, losing 10 of 19 games … In all-time school history, he ranks third in free throw percentage (.830) and fourth in 3-point field goal percentage (.386) … Confident and engaging, Dinwiddie is the self-proclaimed “Mayor,” and a fan favorite.  Received the most votes by the fans at Pachoops.com for having the best moustache in the conference …   Outlook:  Assuming that he can regain his past form, Dinwiddie should be a solid NBA player …  Would fit well alongside an undersized scorer like Monta Ellis … He relies heavily on screens to get shots, is not an especially gifted ball handler, is a little too upright and stiff to defend smaller, quicker guards, and perhaps most importantly, spent a great deal of time playing off the ball in college…  If he wasn’t coming off a serious knee injury, Dinwiddie would be a good bet to be drafted late in the first round, but now, he appears destined to go somewhere in the second…Shooting guard who excels at pushing the ball in traffic … Relentless attacking the basket, particularly in transition. Fearless, aggressive, mentality attacking the rim despite a skinny frame … Good outside shooter with a quick, concise release … Very good spot up shooter … Tremendous handle for a 2-guard. Had more assists than turnovers. Impressive for a freshman who handled the ball a fair amount … Combine that handle with good speed and he is very difficult to contain when he gets a head of steam … Shows solid creativity to finish off plays in transition with scoops and up and unders, even when facing a bigger or more athletic opponent … His aggressive, attacking style results in a lot of trips to the FT line … Very efficient player. Solid decision maker. Good composure, feel for the game … Good length and fluidity … Excellent finisher, despite many of those finishes being the below the rim variety … As he gains a star reputation, many of those 50/50 foul calls that he forces refs to make are likely to go his way …","Needs to get a lot stronger … Added body strength will make him even more effective finishing around the basket and also likely improve his explosiveness … His fearless attacking style in transition can lead to charges and turnovers … Finishes more often with finger rolls than dunks. Not the most explosive athlete, but has great speed and length and should gain some explosiveness as his body develops … While he excels at spot up and transition, he needs to improve his ISO game … While his length and fluidity and focus should make him a good defender in the long run, he needs to improve in that area. He obviously puts a lot more attention into his offensive game …",15.5,0.107,7.8,N

a massive 8’11"" standing reach  … Has a good frame to add weight without the loss of athleticism, and should be an amply sized wing as he inevitably gets bigger … Runs the floor exceptionally well, and is a long strider with good speed and high level leaping skills … Gets off the floor quickly … Covers tons of ground every times he moves … His size and athleticism could allow him to be a Swiss army knife on the defensive end of the floor, as his length and lateral quickness are both tantalizing for a forward … Was pretty good and sound as a defender in the back of Cuse’s 2-3 zone, which bodes well for teams who wanted a clearer read on his ability to adjust to traditional NBA style defense … Nice pick and roll player … Is a good finisher around the rim and gets a high number of dunks … Able to “get skinny” around the rim to finish around defenders … Has some effective finger rolls and scoop shots … Is tough to stop from getting to the rim off the bounce from the foul line …Will be a hard cover for PF’s because of his quickness and ability to attack off the bounce inside the arc…Is generally effective without having many plays run through him … Moves well without the ball and is adept at cutting to the basket for easy baskets … Good offensive rebounder and will get put back dunks if the defense doesn’t box him out … Plays with energy and a good motor, and is willing to put his body on the line for loose balls … Got to the foul line at an extremely impressive rate last season, which speaks to his aggressive nature as a slasher … Has considerable potential as a player, and his ability to continually improve will be largely based on simply putting on pounds which shouldn’t be that hard for him to do … Was on Team USA’s U19 World Championship team this past summer (put didn’t participate in the actual game due to mono), and was applauded for his defensive efforts in practice sessions…Has promise, and will not be 21 years old until near the end of next season … Has relatively limited wear and tear, as he only played extended minutes this past season at Syracuse …Impressive physical specimen of a forward … Has a huge wingspan (7’2""), making him a potential terror on the defensive end … Great all-around athlete … His combination of size and length help him to simply overpower and out athleticism smaller wing forwards … Fantastic shot-blocking wing player … Can guard multiple positions thanks to his length and lateral quickness … Good offensive rebounder who can produce a lot of second-chance buckets … Equally comfortable driving to his right or his left … Decent shooter from out to beyond the 3pt. arc … Unselfish player with good court awareness who makes the extra pass … Capable of rebounding the ball and then running the fast break himself…Has a lot of raw physical tools and a decent skill set at age 19, making him a guy with a lot of upside …","He could have some struggles to find a true position, especially initially in the NBA … Obviously needs to put on weight, and even though he has since HS it has been a fairly slow process and improving his thin body will have an impact on his NBA career … His perimeter skills are a bit underdeveloped, and he shows below average handles and a nonexistent jumper from deep … Pretty predictable off the dribble, and very rarely goes left … No good from anywhere outside of 12 feet as a shooter, and he made 0 3 pointers as a Soph. … Has an awkward release that needs to be overhauled completely … Though he has real good defensive potential and put together some strong defensive performances in college and the World Championships, adjusting his instincts from Boeheim’s 2-3 zone to a largely man to man system will likely take a little time … Showed some raw instincts at times on defense in college …Was not nearly the type of shot-blocker or playmaker on defense his physical tools suggest he should’ve been this past season (0.6 bpg and 0.8 spg) … Reliant on teammates to produce offensively and generally is ineffective when his guards struggle, which happened often down the stretch for Syracuse … Has virtually no post game for a guy who played extended time at the PF spot and projects to play some minutes at PF at the next level in small-ball lineups …Rarely passes the ball … Still is a pretty green player, and has some learning to do before he reaches his potential as a player …Still very raw at this point in time.  Only played 14 MPG last season for Syracuse, indicating that he has a long way to go to be pro-ready…Needs to expand his offensive game.  Isn’t a great ball handler and slasher for a small forward, and doesn’t have any kind of post game … Still a bit thin.  Needs to hit the weights and add some muscle … Shooting consistency is still a bit of an issue … Needs to improve from the stripe.  56% free throw shooter last season..",14.0,0.092,6.8,N

Can drive either direction with either hand …  Finishes strong at the basket, as well … Good NBA body, standing 6’6"" with a solid frame and a 6’9"" wingspan … Good at probing the defense for holes and finding a driving lane to the basket … Runs the floor well and can be a terror in transition … Good lateral quickness and long arms makes him a solid perimeter defender … Attacks the offensive glass and scores on a number of putbacks and second-chance tip-ins … Has great defensive instincts which, along with his long arms, allow him to jump the passing lane and take the ball the other way for an easy finish … Solid shooter from midrange. Shot 49% overall, which is a testament to his efficiency and patience on offense … Doesn’t force things on offense, but when he chooses to attack, he does it with aggression and commitment … Good free throw shooter.  Shot 76% this season. Appears to be a better shooter than his numbers showed based on his form and shooting in practices … Played for a pair of Michigan teams that made deep runs in the tournament …Not to be confused with NFL’s RG3, ""GR3"" is an above the rim athlete with star potential … Smooth. Makes everything look easy. Wing player who attacks the basket and makes highlight finishes … Quick, explosive leaping ability. Gets to the rim in a hurry … Has a good feel for the game and solid perimeter skills …Versatile wing with the ISO ability to create shots off the dribble as well as the vision to find teammates … Runs the floor well and has the fluidity and body control to make acrobatic plays at the rim in transition … Surprising all around skills for a freshman … NBA ready body. Focused. Shows strong maturity, both mentally and physically, for a first year college player … Good decision maker … Very efficient scorer. 59% from the floor … Competitive … Unselfish. Team player.

Adept scorer with the ability to find cracks in the defense and moves well to get open … Solid defender. Gets low, good fundamentals and effort … Slashes to the basket well for rebounds. Understands positioning and boxing out … Physical strength and explosiveness allow him to out-rebound bigger opponents. Good anticipation. Very good second leaper allows him to grab a board and make a follow up dunk … Good length. Wingspan likely in the 6’10 range …","Can sometimes be too passive on offense … Often seemed content to play a secondary role to Nik Stauskas and Mitch McGary (and even Caris LaVert) while at Michigan … Decent, but not great outside shooter … Needs to gain consistency to shoot from behind the arc at an NBA level … Doesn’t always get his feet set when shooting from distance … Shot 31% from 3 this season. An unexpectedly low number considering his shooting ability … Robinson is still maturing as a player.  He’s only 20 years old and often has the mental lapses or losses of concentration that come with that … For being such a tenacious offensive rebounder, Robinson doesn’t exert the same effort on the defensive glass.  Averaged only 3 defensive boards per game this season … Often needs others to set him up to score … Should look to tighten loose handle.  Needs to protect the ball better when it’s in his hands … Can often get overmatched and bullied by bigger forwards, both on the perimeter and inside, but doesn’t have the quickness to play the 2 … Has a poor rate of drawing fouls.  Averaged little more than 3 free throw attempts per game this season … Sometimes he just needs to focus more on making the fundamentally sound play than the game-changing/highlight play … Didn’t quite make the level of improvements he was expected to make after his freshman year, though he certainly did show development …Despite being the team’s most talented prospect, at times can be too unselfish. He is the third option on the Michigan team after Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway Jr., and has accepted his underclassman role being more of a glue guy who looks for baskets within the flow of a game … Some may question his ability to be the star of a team because of this … At 6’6, he’s on the smaller side for the 3 position, but could conceivably develop into a SG over time … Offensive game shows nice potential but still has a lot of room for improvement. Creating and pulling up off the dribble … Shoots a hair below 70% from the FT line.

Bennett’s 42 dunks put him among the country’s leaders. Bennett has made 23 3 pointers this season and averages 1 make per game. Bennett’s sweet spot is the left perimeter where he’s made 40% of his 3 pointers. His go to midrange move is his face up jumper from the right baseline … Two words that bode well for Bennett’s future are productivity and efficiency … He is so efficient that if he played 40 minutes per game he would average 26.2 points per game … He has the innate ability to create spacing which helps him to score whether it’s freezing a defender with a jab step or flaring off of a screen to catch & shoot or flat out blowing by a defender for a power dunk … Bennett continually shows his versatility which raises his intrigue … Bennett’s footwork is excellent, especially for someone of his size. Along with his footwork, Bennett’s shooting mechanics are very good. His form never changes on his shot. His shoulders are always squared and facing the basket.

He’s in constant motion away from the ball, roaming the baseline, cutting backdoor or settling into soft spots. Utilizes that same motor to get out in the open court and runs exceedingly well end to end; averages 1.45 PPP in transition. Plays to his strengths and works hard to ameliorate areas of weakness. He upped his scoring output from 9.7 as a freshman to 16.2 as a sophomore (48% FG). The key ingredient to his offensive explosion was improved long-range proficiency, from 23% to 42% (12 makes to 43). 51% adjusted FG% in spot up opportunities. Highly efficient in the mid-range from either elbow — catch and shoot coming off screens (or working the middle of 2-3) and dribbling into jumpers with one or two habit bounces. His unorthodox style and arm length frequently result in contact; makes excellent use of the pump fake. He gets to the free throw stripe 5 times per game and converts at 77%. Prudent decision maker with ball in hand when asked to facilitate in the Princeton system- 2.7:1.5 assist: turnover ratio. In sync with teammates and uses the dribble to create better passing angles. His feel for the game and nose for the ball are highlighted on the boards. His length/motor/instincts (reading caroms) allow him to chase down misses outside of his area (7.5 REB). Contests every jump shot– even when a shooter creates space, his wingspan negates a clear look (0.9 BLK). Hedges screens aggressively and disrupts hand-offs (1.8 STL).

Plays with great energy and effort … His great length, explosiveness and natural timing which makes him such a dominant shot blocker also makes him a great rebounder and ally oop/put back dunker … Strong rebounder. Shows a willingness to bang inside and fight for rebounds. 9.5 rpg … Good hands to snatch rebounds and make one handed put backs in spectacular fashion … As raw as he is, he seems to have a solid feel for the game and understanding of how to play to his strengths … Showed development in his freshman season, learning to get a wide base, call for the ball, keep it away from guards and make plays, though unpolished, towards the basket … Has developed a little baby hook shot with either hand that has shown some success at times … Shows the ability to face up and get by slower defenders using the dribble … Surprisingly good passer for a bigman. His near 1-1 a/to ratio shows that he passes well and also doesn’t turn the ball over a great deal … His impact on UK has been most apparent after his injury, with the team losing their first game w/out him by 30 to Tennessee … While he lacks much muscle tone, he does show very good aggressiveness attacking the basket and is ""wiry strong"" … While his ACL injury takes some of the luster off of him as a prospect due to the unknowns surrounding him returning to 100%, the fact that he’s so young and today’s technology with athletes such as Adrian Peterson having made such amazing recoveries after surgery helps his cause …An elite-level shot blocker with an extremely high ceiling … Measured 6’11 in shoes with a 7’4"" wingspan, giving him very good length for the center position in the NBA … Explosive athlete with a very quick reaction time … Gets up well on both his first and second jumps, giving him an advantage on the offensive glass … An absolutely intimidating presence in the paint … Blocks an unreal amount of shots due to his length, athleticism, reflexes and timing … Agility allows him to rotate quickly to help teammates defensively … Remarkably fluid runner … Will outrun other bigs down the floor, to set himself up for a number of easy baskets per game … Strong finisher around the rim … Will be an easy alley-oop target at the next level … Uses his physical tools to get a lot of out-of-area rebounds … Defends well on the perimeter … Not beaten easily, even when he switches onto smaller players … Collects a lot of steals for a big man … Isn’t afraid to run the fast break with the ball in his hands …  Very active, plays with a good motor … Unselfish … Has the potential to become a good passer for his position … Confident player that has the stuff to be a dominant defender at Kentucky …   Weaknesses: Needs to add strength to handle the center position in the NBA … Doesn’t get pushed around often at this level and can compensate with his length/athleticism when he does, but that will be a problem in the future if he doesn’t add a significant amount of weight … Prone to biting on pump-fakes, but is often so quick to recover that it doesn’t matter … Can be over-aggressive at times defensively, and get himself in foul trouble … Lacks much of a scoring game. Appears lost offesnively and too often looks to face the basket instead of utilizing his size and athleticism in the post … Needs to polish his post game … Would serve himself well by adding a mid-range jumper and a consistent go-to move in the post to his currently limited offensive repertoire …   Overall: Noel is a top-level defensive player, and a likely one-and-done prospect … He should be able to add the all-around polish he needs to be a very high draft pick at Kentucky next year, and could be considered for the top-overall pick in the 2013 draft …","Offensively, Noel’s game is rudimentary. He has shown some development but the general perception is that he will never be a strong offensive player, instead he impacts games with his defense, rebounding and athleticism … Won’t be able to ""out-athleticize"" opponents for baskets at the next level the way he has in college … Scores mainly on put backs and dunks when he gets a clear path to the basket, or when teammates are able to create for him. That being said, his great foot speed allows him to get by inferior opponents off the dribble at times … Post game is very weak, as a high school player he focused too much on trying to face the basket and use ball handling instead of embracing the idea of being a post player all the time. His lack of post moves/instincts are a result … Lacks touch even around the rim as he’s had some painful misses from point blank range, missing by 2 feet from 4 feet away, etc. … Shows quick feet and explosiveness to get by slower defenders but struggles to make any real post moves. His foot work needs a good deal of improvement … His shooting ability is a major weakness as his lack of a crisp form is apparent when he shoots from the FT line. Lacks a clean, smooth motion, he slings the ball, pushing it instead of allowing his wrists to have a natural release … Legs are alarmingly thin and there could be some concern that the knee injury came as a result of his lack of leg strength … Narrow shoulders will challenge his ability to bulk up considerably. Though there are plenty of NBA bigmen that have had success in the 230 range (which is likely where he will wind up) … His 53% ft shooting illustrates his lack of shooting fundamentals … Unusual athlete, while on one hand he’s an elite level run jump guy with tremendous reflexes and quickness, he plays extremely upright and is stiff and lacking fluidity in some regards …",16.5,0.132,7.4,N

Gets excellent elevation and has a quick release … Has range out to college 3, and there’s no reason to think he won’t be able to extend to the NBA line … If he plays with a top level PG, he will be deadly in catch and shoot situations … His pull up off the dribble shows a lot of potential, as does his ability to blow by defenders due to a quick first step … Ball handling potential is there. Has much better ball handling ability than he’s been given credit for. Shows one and two dribble pull up skills, plus can utilize three and four dribble moves to get to the rim … When asked to isolate, has done a good job of creating off the dribble, though was rarely asked to be a primary ball handler, or ISO, and spent most of his time running off screens for spot up looks … Excellent off the ball, using constant motion to tire out opponents and has been coached well to wait for screens and run his man off them to free himself for looks … Great at finding seems in the defense, running the baseline for ally oop dunks … Has a chance to be an excellent defender due to his length and lateral speed. Despite their reputations, McLemore actually graded out much higher on overall defense in Synergy analytical statistics than Victor Olidipo … McLemore allowed .625 PPP (points per possession) scoring in the 89 percentile (Oladipo .856 PPP and in the 39th percentile) Granted Oladipo has better ISO defensive analytics … Unselfish, team player who shows solid ability to pass the ball for an off guard (even a/to ratio) … Good size at 6’4.75 in shoes with a 6’7.75 wingspan … Persevered through a rough upbringing showing a fortitude and inner strength …Ultra smooth shooting guard with a lethal combination of athleticism and scoring ability … Absolutely an elite level athlete with prototypical size and athleticism for the 2-guard position … Shot has tremendous form, great elevation with the range to knock down the 3 ball consistently … Shows a good feel for the game with the ability to create shots off the dribble … Unselfish, team player who whows strong ability to pass the ball for an off guard … Great length. At 6’5, he appears to have a 6’9 or greater wingspan … Highly coachable kid. Solid feel for the game. Doesn’t gamble for steals or play out of control … Terrorizes opponents with back door cuts that often result in ally oop dunks … Appears to be just scratching the surface of his abilities …","""Lacks assertiveness"" and ""passivity"" are the two most common criticisms that have been made about him. Is it possible that the bar was set a little high for a freshman that averaged 15.9 ppg on highly efficient numbers? … Still must learn how to operate in pressure situations and develop focus and mental toughness … It’s easy to confuse a lack of focus for a lack of passion, and it’s a real possibility that his struggles were more related to inexperience and concentration lapses instead of competitiveness or mental toughness issues … A young and naive kid, there are some concerns about how he will handle all of NBA’s off court temptations and not get caught up in the ""lifestyle"". By all accounts a good kid, who just needs solid people around him steering him in the right direction, making positive decisions … Just one season of college ball after redshirting his first year at Kansas due to Academics … Some worry about his maturity level and confidence after his interviews and workouts. He reportedly was out of shape and unprepared during the draft process … Extremely humble kid. May need time to grow and mature, develop a better feel for the game, defensive spacing, etc. He will likely gain confidence and develop a swagger in time … The truth is he’s a great kid who’s just naive, like most 20 year olds … As one scout put it, ""Just imagine what he’ll be like when he gets some confidence and hits his stride"" … Had one dreadful performance against North Carolina (2 pts 0-9 fg) during their tourney run in which he disappeared and somewhat crumbled under the pressure, and detractors point to this game as proof that he lacks a killer instinct or the ""alpha dog"" personality. In reality the same criticisms could be made about Bradley Beal for ""running from the basketball"" in the key minutes of Florida’s loss to Louisville in the NCAA tournament. McLemore bounced back with 20 pts on 8-15 in their next and last game vs. Michigan … Sometimes the moment overcomes players and only a fool would judge a player based on one college performance … Needs to work on his ISO game, become a better ball handler and not be so careless turning the ball over … Where McLemore struggled defensively was in isolation, showing a need to expand his feel for the game, focus on fundamentals, get lower and not bite on fakes as heavily. Shows solid effort, he just needs to make a better effort of getting low, anticipating, and not allowing opponents to get by him on penetration … Had an extremely tough upbringing so there are some concerns about how he will be able to handle immediate riches … Two years at Kansas were crucial for his maturity and long term development off the court, but has a bigger adjustment curve than the average prospect and needs time and patience from the team that invests a pick in him …Feel for the game must continue to advance. Still figuring out what he’s capable of and learning how to use his immense talents. Shot selection is good but can improve. Learning when to force the issue and when to pass up contested shots. Also when to be aggressive defensively and when not to, in order to stay out of foul trouble … Must develop as a ball handler and become better at creating in isolation … In high school he had some issues with consistency, so he’ll need to learn to exhibit a high level of effort on a more constant basis … Can be a streaky shooter at times … Missed a year having sat out an Academic redshirt season in 2011-12, but it doesn’t seem to have negatively affected him …",9.8,0.035,-3.4,N
603,"Natural scoring ability (18.5 PPG) and effortless range (37% 3PT) in a classic shooting guard frame. He displayed massive improvement from freshman to sophomore campaigns. A more relaxed shooter in his second year, fully utilizing his foundation for better balance to spring into the shot. Solid elevation and consistent point of release. The trey is his layup. One-man show at Georgia — any possession where he found space to fire was a good possession. Pick and roll was usually the offensive set of choice. He delivered 1.03 PPP in 97 overall P&R possessions, and 1.275 PPP when running right side P&R. Highly efficient dribbling into a deep three or pulling up off a hard left drive. Posted a 58.8% Adjusted Field Goal Percentage in spot up opportunities and 50% off a screen. Quick release with catch and shoot in one harmonious motion. Got to the free throw stripe 5.3 times per game as a sophomore, up from 2.5 as a frosh (earned FT’s in 19.2% of transition possessions). High riser off of one-foot behind a head of steam. Outstanding top end speed. One of the top rebounding guards in the nation (7.1 REB) – very much committed to finishing defensive trips and optimizing his 6’8 wingspan. Elite defensive capabilities: gets into his man, moves well side to side, has the length to disrupt shots and plays passing lanes tenaciously (2 SPG). Defense into offense is his forte. Shooting specialist with size and defensive/rebounding skills is never a bad classification.Caldwell-Pope is an offensive minded guard with very good upside as an off-ball scorer … Has nice size on the perimeter at 6’6 and seems to have good length and a frame that should easily be able to get to around 205-210 lbs without any loss of athleticism … Possesses very smooth athleticism and is pretty fluid in his movements … Has solid leaping skills and can play above the rim, especially with a head of steam … Offensively, Caldwell-Pope is mainly known as a shooter who will let it fly in any situation … Attempted 6.7 3’s a night as a Fr., which showed his freedom early in his career and it will probably allow him to be more confident next season for UGA … Has all the tools to be a very good shooting prospect for a team, with the size to get shots off, a high release point, and a reasonably quick release and steady follow through … Already has NBA range on his shot, and is best spotting up, but will shoot from that deep off the dribble and off screens … Shoots a pretty ball and definitely possesses a soft touch … Is a good mid-range shooter too, but he prefers the deep ball … Was a bit of a streak shooter as a Fr., but he is a constant threat with his shot to the D and must be guarded tight when he has the ball … Doesn’t do a bad job finishing around the rim for a guy who is mostly lauded for his potential as a shooter … Is a rangy strider and shows potential getting a step on defenders off 1 dribble to get his shots off … Has a lot of upside and confidence, and should only improve offensively with the experience he garnered as a true Fr … Is good at getting a good jump in the passing lanes to get steals … Pretty fundamentally sound defender who is competitive on that end … Very willing and effective rebounder for a wing player … Slightly more physical than he’s given credit for … Really looks likely to blossom in the near future as a player, solid worker and wants to improve …","Caldwell-Pope’s repertoire is highly dependent on perimeter accuracy. Often takes the easy way out, settling for long range bombs rather than using his athleticism. 52% of his shots come from behind the arc. Smooth athlete, but lacks short range quickness or explosiveness — while he uses the dribble adeptly to buy space for jumpers (hesitation and step back), he does not possess blow by or shake up handles to get all the way to the rim. Attack needs to be encouraged. Adding strength would promote a more aggressive mentality as well. Does not serve as a facilitator with the ball in his hands, rarely aiding the cause of teammates. Posted a negative assist: turnover ratio of 1.8:2. Defensive prowess notwithstanding, he can be flighty at times and choose potential rewards over standard awareness; a trait not aided by his team’s inability to score.For a guy who was a very highly touted shooter/player out of HS, Caldwell-Pope struggled with his efficiency as a Fr … He has the tools to eventually be a big threat with his shot, but he has plenty of kinks … He has a natural shot, but he is prone to taking contested shots with a hand in his face and doesn’t show very good shot selection yet … Needs time and space to be most effective with his stroke, doesn’t react to tight D or closeouts that well right now … He also presses, and will try and shoot himself out of slumps even if better shots can be found later in the shot clock for himself and teammates … UGA needed immediate scoring from him and he had a much shorter leash than Fr. typically do, and it showed with his decisions quite a bit … Falls in love with his jumper, doesn’t put the ball on the floor often enough at all … Actually was better the closer he was to the rim last year, but doesn’t have the handles or willingness to slash to take advantage of it that often … Isnt more than a basic straight line ball-handler, not going to break down a defense off the bounce much…Got to the foul line at a poor rate (2.5 ftpg) for a guy who played 32 mpg and put up 12 shots per game, and was he only hit 65% of his free throws, showing the massive improvements he needs to make … Not very strong or big right now, still growing into his body … Can be prone to falling asleep defensively, as a result of his youth and inexperience … Doesn’t pass the ball much …",11.9,0.084,6.6,N

Can he be a starting PG, and if so can he do it on on a winning team? Due to being undersized, these questions must be asked … He doesn’t show the jitterbug quickness to gain separation on quicker guards which is a concern considering his size … Not the most athletic guard. Solid but not spectacular. Not a player that will dunk in traffic or be a dynamic finisher … His numbers show that he’s more effective in the half court than in transition … A better scorer than distributor, though his vision and passing ability shows flashes … Despite averaging 6.8 apg, scouts aren’t completely sold on his vision and ability to make everyone around him better … Needs to work on his pick and roll skills … As clutch a player as he is, his ISO ability is compromised by a lack of elite speed off the dribble and average first step … Much more effective going to his right. Will need to work on using his left hand and ability to go left in order for team’s not to overplay him to one side, limiting his effectiveness … Should look to add a tear drop to his arsenal.

has a high release on his jump shot that is difficult to defend … Has range out to the NBA three-point line … Good ball-handling skills that still have the potential to get better … Has shown the ability to break down defenders off the dribble, especially when driving to his left … Possesses a nice looking runner that he doesn’t use often, but could turn into an important skill down the road … Solid defender with a fair amount of potential left in this area … Good lateral quickness and length makes him difficult to beat off the dribble … Has been a clutch performer in the past, especially during UConn’s national title run in 2011 … A prospect that should be able to produce right away as somebody that excels playing off the ball, but also has the potential to become better at creating for himself …   Weaknesses: Very thin at this point … Added strength should help him finishing through contact in the future … Doesn’t shoot a lot of free-throws (3.6 attempts in 37.2 minutes per game) which is a real shame as he has the athleticism to get to the rim a lot and the touch to convert a high percentage of attempts from the stripe … Still limited when creating offense for himself … Most of the turnovers he commits occur due to his inexperience handling the ball … Strongly favors driving left and is extremely mistake prone when driving right … Three-point percentage dipped from 36.8% in 2010-2011 to 33.6% in 2011-2012, likely due to the extra attention teams could give him with Kemba Walker having left the team for the NBA … Effort level is inconsistent defensively …

improvement and could be polished over the next few years with added experience and a good coaching staff … With everything Lamb offers, he’s unlikely to slip out of the lottery on draft night …Lamb is a thin 6’5 wing with a monster wingspan (around 7’1) … A good athlete with nice fluidity and quickness, and solid explosiveness and leaping skills … Runs the floor very well … Plays with great composure and proved to be extremely clutch in UConn’s run through the NCAA tournament … Shows a very promising game off the dribble, and is able to stick pull-up jumpers pretty well right now … Pretty good ball-handling skills … Rangy strider and quick 1st step allows him to get a step on defenders pretty well … Likes to use floaters in the lane, and will use to the glass to bank shots in … Capable spot-up jump shooter with consistent range out to the college 3-point line, and has the ability to make shots off screens and curls too … Will move without the ball … Lamb proved to be a very good defender last season for UConn, and that’s really promising considering he was a Fr. on a nat’l title team and in a competitive league like the Big East … He was able to defend all 3 perimeter positions effectively with his length and quickness , which is intriguing considering his youth … Length and quick hands proved him to be a threat as a ball-thief, and it created transition opportunities for himself and teammates …Willing rebounder … Generally shows a high basketball IQ and has a lot of the traits of a former player’s son (his dad, Rolando Lamb, was an NBA draft pick) … Reportedly has a strong work ethic, which will be needed for him to reach his potential …","The most noticeable chink in Mr. Lamb’s arsenal revolves around his lack of bulk and strength … Lamb is very thin and he has the narrow shoulders that will make adding significant weight harder than usual … His lack of girth and strength shows in certain aspects of his game too, mainly around the rim offensively and as a off-ball defender … Got to the free throw line at an abysmal rate, due to a lack of confidence in his strength, and settled for pull-ups and floaters much more often than he chose to challenge players who protected the rim in half-court situations … Lamb generally struggled finishing around the rim against contact, despite having more than adequate length and athleticism to do so … On D, Lamb’s lack of strength showed when getting through screens … He has enough length to contest even when screens set up what appears to be a clean look for his matchup against college teams, but with bigger guys setting those screens in the NBA, he will likely have to adjust … He was promising on D for UConn last year he will have to get stronger to defend NBA guards consistently …

Range has extended to three-point territory, shooting 40% on over 1 attempt per game last season. 77% shooter at the free throw stripe, to which he is a frequent visitor. Strong basketball IQ- reads double teams, finds the open man and rarely get careless with the ball (1.2 AST: 1.9 TO). Excellent anticipation on the glass, clears room with his big frame (9 RPG, 3 Offensive). Intuitive defender with good hands (1.2 steals). Averaged a shade over a block per game last year, a healthy upgrade from 0.5 as a freshman. Added muscle weight and improved conditioning that resulted in more effective minutes at full strength, as well as more explosive movements.Sullinger has decent size for a post player measuring 6’9” (in shoes) with a 6’11.5” wingspan … He is a bruising throwback post player that uses his 286 pound body to create angles for his shot and to clear space on the boards … Very physical player that uses his body to wear down opposing big men…The Ohio State commit is also very skilled with a repertoire of advanced post moves for a high school player…Comfortable finishing around the rim with either hand … Has excellent hands and footwork and shows very good touch around the basket … Solid rebounder, he attacks the glass at both ends of the floor and creates offensive opportunities off of putbacks…Shows decent form and touch on the 12-18 footer … Passes well out of the post … He’s a winner, leading his Columbus Northland squad to an Ohio Divison 1 state championship and his All-Ohio Red AAU squad to three consecutive National Championships …  Weaknesses: Does not possess elite athleticism…Is prone to having his shot blocked and has some difficulty with longer athletic defenders…Does not run the floor extremely well…Shows ability, but needs to improve consistency of mid-range jumper…Lateral quickness is lacking, creating defensive mismatches versus perimeter oriented PFs…Is not a particularly dominant defensive player due to lack of explosiveness and quickness…Weight could be a long-term issue, not a particularly solid 262 pounds…Potential one-and-done lottery guy, but must improve conditioning and mid-range game and show that he can dominate at the college level …","Lacks the overall physical gifts of other top prospects in the draft class. Appears stuck in glue at times, particularly against long, athletic competition. His space-creating advantage and wide base are nullified. No elevation off the floor and severely limited explosion. Plays beneath the rim. Run the courts laboriously. Lateral quickness is poor- badly exposed in space and on pick and roll switches. Undersized for the center position, a shortcoming he does not make up for in length. Major concerns defensively against new breed, mobile NBA 4’s. Not an intimidating presence on the back line of a defense. Less than a blocked shot per game in conference play, and does not alter attempts either. Averaged more steals than blocks. Position defender. He’s overwhelmed by size, length and athleticism on both sides of the ball. The majority of his dominant efforts came against lesser competition and teams devoid of frontline size. His 5/19 performance in his final collegiate game against Kansas did not aid his draft standing. His body style will always be susceptible to weight issues. Can’t afford to rest on his laurels and be satisfied with current level of conditioning and agility if he wants to remain in the lottery.",16.2,0.113,2.7,N

He seems to tighten up rather than be free-flowing with his movements, serving as a detriment to his first step. Lost some explosion in quickness and leaping departments with added bulk—stiffness.

down low too … Fairly decisive finisher down low, who uses his wide lower body to seal in good position to get the pass and go up with shots before the defense collapses on him … Works hard moving without the ball, and isn’t indifferent to throwing his body in his man down low to establish very deep position … Although he’s not likely to seal NBA PF’s as much as he did in college, he also can

some questions about what position he will defend with the most effectiveness … Insists that he sees himself as a SF more than a PF, but he has never really played SF dating back to HS, and would

intensity on this end, and will allow baskets without much resistance around the rim, particularly against the bigger, more athletic PF’s he faced … Wasn’t that great a defensive rebounder (5.5 a game) and will ball-watch, and gives up rebounds on the defensive end that give offenses 2nd chance opportunities at times … Although he generally is decisive, Williams struggles at times with defenders crowding him and is pretty turnover prone when he gets collapsed upon … Doesn’t look to pass the ball very much … Saw limited minutes at times in games due to foul trouble … Won’t be a big threat in the passing lanes or blocking shots at the NBA level …Williams is slightly undersized for a power forward at the next level, lacking great bulk … He will likely always use speed and length to compensate for a lack of brute strength … He would really benefit from developing a consistent mid range jump shot … His face up game would be more effective, and it would add another dimension to his offensive repertoire … At times, takes him a little too long to execute his move and get off his shot … Needs to improve vision in the post – when the ball goes down low to him it rarely gets

724,"Walker’s game is marked by ""electricity"" and explosiveness. Plays with an undefinable burst, seemingly moving in warp speed while everyone else is standing still- yet he remains for the most part under control, with the ball on a string. Working in his favor is a freakish blend of raw speed, breathtaking quickness, ultra-aggression and sneaky power. Scores from anywhere on the court (23.5 ppg). Can’t be contained by a single defender off the dribble, be it in the half court or most notably in transition. Splits double teams and traps in a blink. Changes direction at FULL speed. He is a master at creating space, using jab steps, cross overs and pump fakes to shed defenders. Highly creative with the rock in his hands and finishing at the rim. Able to complete plays through contact with a full head of steam. Also able to re-adjust angles and avoid shot blockers by hanging and improvising in mid-air. Constantly in attack mode, frequently living at the charity stripe (7.7 attempts). Scoop shots and floaters are not foreign to his arsenal either. Overall shooting aptitude has improved dramatically since arriving on campus. His range shooting is now a real weapon (33% on 5.5 attempts), despite a myriad of low percentage, bail out chucks. He’s always been extremely comfortable shooting step back J’s off the dribble, but displayed a new wrinkle coming off screens as the season progressed. Solid elevation and high release. Tremendous two-footed leaper in space. Despite his gift for the putting the ball in the bucket, he’s very much a facilitator (4.5 apg), creating open shots for others by commanding a second/third defender. Prolific rebounder for his size (5.4 rpg), completely unafraid to mix it up with bigger bodies. Excellent lateral quickness with fluid hips. Beats the offensive player to the spot. Opportunistic defensively- if you’re careless with the ball, he’ll take it back the other way for a deuce (1.9 stl). His motor never runs low (38 minutes per). A true winner with a warrior’s spirit.  ","His measurement of 6’1 with shoes was a win, but he remains an undersized commodity, his standing reach of 7’7.5 is the same as 5’10 PG Isaiah Thomas. Defending the new breed of NBA point guards will be a severe challenge. He takes a ton of hits in his 184-pound frame, and while he’s been anything but fragile, it’s a concern over the long haul. Walker’s an unselfish distributor and a dynamic playmaker, but he’ll never be mistaken for an orchestrator or true lead guard. Connecticut’s half court offense was largely late clock isolations: can he get a team organized and operate an NBA style, functional system? Has a tendency to play out of control times, but to his credit he has learned to pace himself when the situation calls for it (2.3 turnovers). It’s difficult to cage a lion, and as a result he will go through patches where he gets caught up in the emotion of the game. Too many out of control shot attempts, attacking the trees wildly when there’s simply nothing available. Fearless is a great quality as long as it doesn’t reach the point of reckless. Criticizing him for lack of efficiency (43% fg) is probably unfair given the tremendous burden placed upon his shoulders. Nevertheless, he does have a tendency to waste possessions. He finished in traffic at the collegiate level, but the NBA paint is a different animal. Continued advancement in the mid-range, pull up game will go a long ways in getting more quality looks and saving his body. Shooting stroke needs fine tuning, particularly from range. Arc on his jumper brings rain and inhibits consistent results.  Adam Ganeles 5/24/11Kemba’s main flaw, other than his size, seems to be his poor decision making … Occasionally takes bad shots, and forces the issue … Being under 6 feet tall at the next level will hurt him, as he may struggle to convert in traffic … Gets his shot blocked too often, a problem that will only increse at the next level if he doesn;t make an adjustment … Tends to force up shots or unrealistically attempt to draw fouls in the paint, when he should look to penetrate and kick it out … Sometimes has his mind set on his next move before he sees what’s given to him … Still turnover prone, although he plays 35 minutes per game so the ball is in his hands a lot … He lacks consistent range on his jumper, and will need to improve in that department … Defensively, he’s quick and moves well, however his lack of size at the next level will allow other guards to shoot/pass over him … Lack of strength might allow others to push him around against taller, stronger guards … Should look to add a better floater in the lane instead of penetrating in so far every time …Lack of size (he’s listed at 6-foot-1, but is probably closer to 6-feet) creates some limitations on both offense and defense … Like many young players, Walker often gets caught trying to do too much … Many of his turnovers are the result of overdribbling or making an extra pass when it is not needed … Still lacks experience and can be a bit erratic with the ball … Assist to turnover ratio is essentially 1-to-1 (2.8 assists per game and 2.7 turnovers).

create as much space for himself in the NBA the way he did in college … Able to aggressively finish in college at the rim, but will have difficulty when challenging 7 footers at the next level …Crafty player whose consistent lefty stroke and ability to post up have made him a very difficult matchup … He prefers catching the ball just inside the 3 point arc, facing up, using jabs to create space and either letting it fly or taking his man off the dribble … His shot is a text book left handed release, it is very efficient with no wasted motion … Currently he operates mostly in the midrange, but has shown plenty of range to step behind the NBA arc … He gets minimal elevation, but he uses this to his advantage, as he can shot fake and make a move with very little effort … His understanding of spacing and movement could make him a great pick& roll player … For a player his size, his handles are pretty impressive, he is very comfortable pushing the ball in transition off a rebound or putting it on the deck and attacking his match up in the halfcourt … Going both ways he has a nice mid-range pull up that is very difficult to defend because he throws in a stepback and a fadaway to keep the defense guessing … With his back to the basket, he uses head and shoulder fakes before shooting his soft turnaround jumper … He has a fairly strong upper body that allows him to clear space and go to the glass …  Weaknesses: For all the craftiness, his physical shortcomings are still fairly exposed … He lacks the explosiveness and athleticism to matchup with the PF position, and his mediocre lateral quickness and first step will give him fits defending wing players, or trying to beat them off the dribble … He needs to diversify his low post game, even though his jumper is a tremendous weapon, he will need to incorporate some new moves if he is to exploit smaller players … Settling too much for the midrange shot, makes him seem passive at times, rather than taking the ball to the rim and drawing contact, he seems to shy away from it … His dribbling gets him into trouble as he tries to push the ball against pressure or when he over penetrates into traffic … He shows flashes of his range and touch from the outside, but currently he is only attempting 2.2 threes per game, and shooting at a mediocre 36% (has not made more than 2 threes in a game) … He needs to become more consistent and prove that he can spread the defense game in and game out, but with experience and as he grows more comfortable playing away from the basket, there is no reason to think he won’t be able to accomplish this …"," Without question the tweener label fits Babbitt … The biggest obstacle Babbitt will have to overcome is guarding small forwards at the next level, since he is not

He’s a very talented offensive player, but the question remains whether he can show off that talent every time he takes the floor … His jump shot is on and off, and his shot selection at times can be in question … Tends to disappear throughout stretches of games … His offensive rebounding rate is alarmingly low… Shot 42 percent from the field, extremely low for a 6’10 player with as much talent as he has … His lack of aggresiveness and willingness to bang inside are partly to blame … Defensively, again he is not the strongest in regards to forwards his size, and he lacks the lateral quickness to defend off the dribble against more athletic forwards … At 22 years old, his upside will be looked at as limited …Currently he is in the hybrid forward mold, capable playing both positions, but not quite ready to play either on the next level … To become a full time post player he will need to add weight and muscle to his frame … He struggles when he takes contact, and because he gets taken out of position he has to operate off balance … He strongly prefers turning to his right shoulder (where he tends to shoot an awkward right handed turnaround), making him somewhat predictable and easy to defend on the block …On the perimeter, he settles for jumpshots, primarily because his handles aren’t good enough to allow him to get to the hoop on a consistent basis … While he is a very good midrange shooter, he needs to add range and consistency to his outside shot … His fadeaway can be very effective at times, but it can also be the reason behind many shots being left short in the second half of games … He has been sporadic from the free throw line all season, and he shoots a very underwhelming 70% … He has very long arms, but he has not shown the willingness to becomes a disruptive force on the defensive end, either by blocking shots, or by getting into the passing lanes …",3.1,-0.089,-0.2,Y

While being known as a player who is best when working in the high post from either elbow, he has displayed a solid game from the baseline recently, where he can turn over either shoulder to hit the baseline jumper. He has added a behind the back dribble move to his repertoire that isnt fully reliable yet, but will make him a little more dangerous when working from the top of the key nonetheless. His leadership has developed more and he is a reliable go to guy offensively in the post. Defensively, his post position is very good, so he shouldnt have too many problems with man-to-man defense at the next level.Weaknesses: Koufos must get better at finishing at the rim after contact.

His ball-handling, is fantastic, especially in the open court, as he played a lot of guard before his reaching his full height. Hawes is very smooth on the court, and has a great, soft touch around the basket. He possesses good shooting form, and has range out to three point distance, but is only consistent to about 18 feet. He is very fundamentally sound, with excellent footwork in the post. He will immediately be one of the best passing big men in the country, whether its out of the post, double team, in the open court, or on the perimeter. He is a decent shot-blocker, but does position himself well on defense.Weaknesses: Definitely needs to bulk up more for life in the paint in college. He needs to develop alternate post moves. He lacks great quickness. He will occasionally settle for taking outside shots instead of attacking from the post. His rebounding skills could be improved. Spencer is not an amazing athlete and has trouble with smaller quicker opponents. He could improve his overall defense.Notes: Hawes chose Washington over North Carolina, Connecticut, and Stanford, among others. He participated in the 2006 McDonalds All-American game.

968," Can create mismatches all over the floor with his size and point guard skills, i.e. dribbling and passing. Can take bigger guys off the dribble and post up smaller players. Able to play the finesse game as well as be a bull in the post. Very tough minded, which is a misconception based upon his slight frame. Led the Jayhawks in rebounding his sophomore year by a wide margin with 7.8 per game, with the next highest total being 5.6 rpg. Improved in every statistical category his sophomore year besides blocks, which stayed on pace at 1.3 per game. A very hard worker, evidenced by his statistical climb from freshman to sophomore year and the noticeable improvement on his jumpshot. Capable of making eye popping plays either as a distributor, a finisher and also on the defensive end of the floor. A great personality in the locker room, any team looking to change the attitude in the locker room or strengthen team chemistry would be doing themselves a disservice by overlooking him. A player capable of filling up the stat sheet; Kirilenko-esque.Weaknesses: First and foremost, his jumpshot. While it is undoubtedly improved, there is still much work to be done. With a reliable jumpshot that defenders would have to respect, the damage Julian could do to opposing defenses would jump tenfold. Also alarming is Julians performance at the 2007 combine where he came in 66th in total athleticism. Especially startling is his performance in the bench press drills where he could only lift the 185 pound bar twice. After two full years with a major collegiate teams strength program, one would think he would be able to lift more than two reps. Also, which position does Julian fit in the pros? He is a quick four? A big three? It would come down to team need I believe and offensive philosophy.Conclusion: On the right team, Julians style of play could ignite a teams offense. His long arms, he measured in with a 72 wingspan and a 9 standing reach at the combine, allow his to play bigger than he really is and equip him to play frustrating on the ball defense. While his lack of strength might raise some red flags, it never seemed to be an issue while playing at Kansas, where he faced first class talent on an almost nightly basis. Patience is the key with Julian; once he figures out his role on the team and what he is capable of, and also if he is ever able to consistently knock down his outside jumpers, then the dividends of his game will unfold.Matthew Maurer – 12/22/2006Strengths: For his size, he is a tremendous passer able to make impressive plays Unselfish player who gets his teammates involved in the offense … Excellent court vision, sees the floor with ease Smart player who doesnt force things.

Has a great fake and hesitations package, which he uses to beat his defender off the dribble or on fast-break. Excellent ball-handler and very good passer as a PG, deadly one-on-one skills as SG.

He has a 38 inch vertical, which is usually among the top three in each draft-worthy class. He jumps off the ground rapidly, enabling him to grab rebounds and convert put backs that a player his size normally wouldn’t. He doesn’t run the floor much, so his speed is not exhibited, but this could be primarily due to Coach Bo Ryan’s slower paced offense … He has added strength without compromising his athletic ability. He remains a springy leaper, able to grab boards from players that are bigger and/or stronger. The offense has gotten more fast-break opportunities, and they often end with a Tucker dunk. He’ll be an excellent finisher, especially in transition, due to his athletic ability In the past 2 years he has added definition without losing agility, especially in the arms. This has allowed him to convert better after contact, to post or defend the post, and in boxing out … Alando is blessed with a very long wingspan, making him play like someone who is 6’7″. He uses his length well in defending, rebounding, and finishing close to the basket. His hands are excellent. He catches everything, and deflects with his alert hands. His hands are large enough to easily palm a ball, which is an underrated attribute for slashers … He has greatly improved his ball-handling to the point where it’s probably average if not slightly better than average for an NBA small forward. This enables him to easily beat bigger forwards off the dribble, and post up smaller guards with great intelligence and savvy … Tucker is very patient on offense, rarely forcing the issue on ill-advised drives. This aspect of his game has shown an amazing improvement in the past year. He has added a great midrange jumper, especially after a jab step or ball-fake. Essentially, he sets up the jumper with the threat of driving. He often makes use of his superior athleticism, even when it comes to his improved J, backing his man down, then stepping out to shoot. Defensively he has terrific lateral quickness when guarding perimeter players. He uses his feet extremely well, which will be a great attribute when playing against the quicker NBA guards. Tucker’s long and lively arms make it difficult for players roughly his size to pass around him. Not only a physically gifted defender, Alando is a smart defender as well. Rotates well, and is versatile enough to cover four positions in college, but probably two or three in the NBA, depending on the height/quickness of the opposition. His added strength, coupled with his wingspan, quickness, leaping ability, and smarts, will likely permit him to guard most NBA small forwards … His size, length, and smarts, with an improved effort, could make him become a great pro defender. Despite this, it is very clear to anyone that has watched his career, from his first season as a scrappy, raw, 6’5″ 190-195 lbs power forward to this year, as a polished, seasoned star capable of easily creating his own shot in a variety of ways, that his offseason training is top notch. He clearly works hard on his gameCjump-shooting, dribbling, film, etcCand will likely continue to do so in the future … His basketball IQ is very high, as he has become even more cunning on offense, He has also gained a “leader’s swagger” that he previously lacked, indicating his arrival as Wisconsin’s top dog.","Defensively Tucker could stand to improve on his intensity Doesnt seem to possess great anticipation skills nor the awareness to play the passing lanes Ball handling, while improved, still isnt great Perimeter shooting remains prone to streakiness Not a great shooter coming off screens Solid three point shooter when his feet are set but struggles to hit with regularity due in part to his slow release Despite being a great athlete, Tucker rarely explodes off the dribble due to his average first step Doesnt always use the mid-range jumper to his advantage, often hell slash to the basket or shoot the three From a position standpoint there is concern about what position he will play in the NBA While blessed with athleticism, he may struggle to shoot consistently enough to play shooting guard and his height might be a detriment at small forward While his game has progressed considerably over the past 5 years, one has to wonder how much more he can improve Below average free throw shooting limits his ability to take full advantage of the contact he createsAt 6’5″, Alando is slightly undersized to play shooting guard and is very undersized to be an NBA small forward. But his length and athleticism help … He sometimes forces shots, not many, but some. This almost always happens near the baseline. I however doubt that this’ll be much of a problem in the NBA, as he won’t be called to carry the scoring load … He still does not catch and shoot, and oftentimes takes a bit of time before making his initial move. His shooting form may be a bit of a concern. Oftentimes, an ugly yet effective form, such as Leandro Barbosa’s, gets unfairly criticized. If a shot works, it works, and the form usually is exceptionally overrated. However, Tucker has a very low release point, potentially having his shot vulnerable to getting blocked. This may not be a problem, since it has not stopped other awkward shooters, like Shawn Marion … Alando still has excellent tools to become a great defender, but he seems to not try as hard as he used to. This may be because he tries to conserve energy for the increased scoring load he carries. In the NBA, he’ll have to play with intensity on the defensive side, as that’ll likely be his calling card.",13.0,0.045,-0.3,Y
