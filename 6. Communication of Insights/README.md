#### IST-736 Text Mining

The subfolder under "Section 6: Communication of Insights" from the IST-736 Text Mining course contains comprehensive materials demonstrating the application of data science tools in text mining, particularly focusing on the analysis of NBA drafts. It includes:

    Concepts and Techniques in Text Mining: Documents and examples showcasing information extraction, text classification and clustering, topic modeling, and the use of commercial and open-source text analysis and visualization tools.

    NBA Draft Analysis Project: This project used text mining to analyze pre-draft commentary and player statistics. The focus was on determining predictive indicators of a player's success or failure using machine learning models and techniques like Random Forest, LSTM, Naïve Bayes, SVMs, and LDA for topic allocation and sentiment analysis.

    Data Visualization Samples: The folder contains visualizations like WordClouds and scatter plots, illustrating the most frequently occurring words and their associated sentiment scores, along with sentiment score distributions and their relationship to player success.

    Sentiment Analysis and Predictive Modeling: Detailed analysis using sentiment scores to predict player performance. This includes logistic regression and Bayesian analysis for assessing reporting completeness, and linear regression for understanding belief exemptions.

    Machine Learning Model Analysis: Results from applying supervised machine learning models like SVM and Random Forest, including accuracy measures, confusion matrices, and decision boundaries.

    PyLDAvis Visualization: Insights derived from the PyLDAvis library, showcasing 25 distinct topics found in the “Weaknesses_Preprocessed” text data, revealing common themes and player attributes.

    Comprehensive Reports and Presentations: Technical reports and presentations detailing the methodologies, findings, and implications of the analyses, geared towards non-technical audiences.

This subfolder serves as a resource for understanding how text mining and machine learning can be applied to sports analytics, specifically in the context of NBA scouting. It exemplifies the combination of technical proficiency in data science tools and effective communication of complex insights.
