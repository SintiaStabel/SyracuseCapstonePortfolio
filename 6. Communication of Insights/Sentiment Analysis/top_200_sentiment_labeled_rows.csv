202378,Willie Warren,2010,2,24,54,Draft,1610612746,Los Angeles,Clippers,LAC,Oklahoma,College/University,1,Willie,Warren,,,89.0,Ben Gordon/Rodney Stuckey,"Was considered by most as a lottery type talent before the season … Warren’s biggest asset in regards to being successful at the next level is his ability to create shots for himself, and shoot the ball off the dribble … An offensive-minded combo-guard, uses a quick first step and athleticism to create space and get in the paint … He can make shots of the highest difficulty, labeled a ""good bad-shot shooter"" … Deep offensive shot-arsenal … Strong finisher around the rim, averages 6 free throw attempts per game… Shows explosiveness and impressive body control in traffic… NBA body, confident scorer who has shown glimpses of possessing point guard potential… An above average passer, with ability to split the defense and open things up for teammates … Has an excellent handle,  with NBA 3 point range… An explosive combo guard with a wide and strong body … He has a great first step, good leaping ability and long arms, which allows him to turn the corner and make difficult plays in traffic … Extremely confident, he enjoys taking big shots in crucial situations … Plays with an edge that is necessary to succeed … He has become a reliable outside threat, consistently making open and contested shots (48% FG and 38% 3PT)… He shoots with great balance, allowing his shooting range to extend well beyond the NBA arc … Has an array of moves off the dribble (crossovers, behind the back, spins, in & outs), and uses hesitation moves to keep the defense off-balance … He is occasionally given spot duty at the PG position and he has shown the ability to lead a team … His court vision is decent and his passing ability is also fairly good … Defensively his strength and quickness will allow him to eventually defend both backcourt positions …","Warren suffers from a poor shot selection, and when asked to be the number 1 scoring option, he struggled making shots … Overly ball-dominant, tends to over-dribble and take his teammates out of the game … Very turnover prone, finds himself out of control frequently after forcing the issue… this past year has not been an effective catch and shooter, shooting a dreadful 30% from downtown …  Defensively he is uninspiring, seeming to get his rest on this side of the ball … Poor footwork results in allowing his man to get into the paint way too often … Undisciplined decision maker, with an inconsistent jump shot, negative attitude and troublesome ankle will put a scare in some coaches and GMs … Apparently was at odds with Coach Capel and those close to the team pointed to lack of maturity and selfishness as reasons for Warren’s inability to fill the high expectations in his sophomore year (aside from missing extended time due to having mononucleosis) … There is some concern over whether he’s truly a point guard or even a combo. Shows some solid passing and ball handling skills, but has never proven to be a true floor general that can take over a team and run the show at a high level … Lacks a natural position at the next level, he is an undersized SG and is not a pure playmaker … He plays with a scorers mentality and at times only looks to pass as a last resort … Has the potential to become a deadly drive and dish player, but he needs to trust his teammates more … Plays out of control, forcing drives into heavy traffic and then leaving his feet to make plays … He does not maximize his explosiveness to get by people, rather he plays around with the ball on the perimeter before putting up difficult and contested shots … He is a bit of a ball stopper on offense, wasting dribbles and also putting up bad shots out of the offense and early in the shot clock … His outside shot has been fairly consistent all season, but he has a bit of a slow release as he takes his time getting his feet set … His release is also low (coming almost off his chin) and he tends to pull the string on challenged shots … Being undersized, the midrange part of his game will have to become a key aspect, but he still needs some major work on it; he is often fading and off-balance shooting pullups, all equalling in very mixed results… Defensively, he is not ready mentally for the next level, constantly loosing sight of his man and getting beaten of the dribble by inferior athletes …",,," If the draft was a straight up talent contest, Warren would be a lottery pick, just as he potentially was after his freshman season … A prime example of why players leave college early when their stock is high, Warren had a rough second season playing the role of go-to scorer with Blake Griffin leaving for the NBA … He can score in a variety of ways, and if he gets back to that complimentary scorer mentality he had as a freshman, he could make for a nice scoring option off the bench … His lack of concentration on the defensive side of the ball, along with his all around questionable attitude and poor results when asked to play a larger role are 3 significant factors when explaining his lowered draft stock … Warren also had an arrest for driving with a suspended liscense after the season … With his high skill level though, he can be a steal if he slips too far … Jonathan Wasserman 5/3/10",yes,10.8,0.065,0.0,considered lottery type talent season warren biggest asset regard successful next level ability create shot shoot ball dribble offensiveminded comboguard us quick first step athleticism create space get paint make shot highest difficulty labeled good badshot shooter deep offensive shotarsenal strong finisher around rim average 6 free throw attempt per game show explosiveness impressive body control traffic nba body confident scorer shown glimpse possessing point guard potential average passer ability split defense open thing teammate excellent handle nba 3 point range explosive combo guard wide strong body great first step good leaping ability long arm allows turn corner make difficult play traffic extremely confident enjoys taking big shot crucial situation play edge necessary succeed become reliable outside threat consistently making open contested shot 48 fg 38 3pt shoot great balance allowing shooting range extend well beyond nba arc array move dribble crossover behind back spin out us hesitation move keep defense offbalance occasionally given spot duty pg position shown ability lead team court vision decent passing ability also fairly good defensively strength quickness allow eventually defend backcourt position,warren suffers poor shot selection asked number 1 scoring option struggled making shot overly balldominant tends overdribble take teammate game turnover prone find control frequently forcing issue past year effective catch shooter shooting dreadful 30 downtown defensively uninspiring seeming get rest side ball poor footwork result allowing man get paint way often undisciplined decision maker inconsistent jump shot negative attitude troublesome ankle put scare coach gm apparently odds coach capel close team pointed lack maturity selfishness reason warren inability fill high expectation sophomore year aside missing extended time due mononucleosis concern whether he truly point guard even combo show solid passing ball handling skill never proven true floor general take team run show high level lack natural position next level undersized sg pure playmaker play scorer mentality time look pas last resort potential become deadly drive dish player need trust teammate play control forcing drive heavy traffic leaving foot make play maximize explosiveness get people rather play around ball perimeter putting difficult contested shot bit ball stopper offense wasting dribble also putting bad shot offense early shot clock outside shot fairly consistent season bit slow release take time getting foot set release also low coming almost chin tends pull string challenged shot undersized midrange part game become key aspect still need major work often fading offbalance shooting pullups equalling mixed result defensively ready mentally next level constantly loosing sight man getting beaten dribble inferior athlete,,11.28421053,3.65,41.18736842,0.126829296,Y,Y,Y,Y,-0.9866,0
201985,AJ Price,2009,2,22,52,Draft,1610612754,Indiana,Pacers,IND,Connecticut,College/University,1,AJ,Price,,,89.0,,"Has developed into an excellent long-range shooter … Price was just a 27 percent 3-point shooter in his first season at UConn (as a sophomore), but has since increased that number to 41 percent … Is equally adept at catching-and-shooting and creating his own shot off the dribble … Can knock down some very difficult jumpshots with taller, more athletic defenders in his face … Gets tremendous lift on his jumpshot, which helps compensate for his less-than-stellar athleticism … Has a good, solid build for an NBA point guard at 6-foot-2, 190-pounds … Uses his body well to get into the lane and has improved considerably at knocking down floaters and short pull-up jumpshots … Possesses above-average quickness on both ends … Has quick hands and is very alert defensively … Price has matured into a vocal leader for UConn … Even when he plays off-the-ball (when freshman Kemba Walker mans the point guard position), Price shouts out the play call and makes sure that everyone is in the proper place … Is a real winner and a true warrior on the court.  ","Is not a high level NBA athlete … While his quickness is fine, Price doesn’t jump particularly well, which hinders his ability to finish at the rim … He gets good elevation on his jumpshot, but will have a much tougher time shooting over the elite athletes who play in the NBA … Is more of a scoring point guard … Has decent court vision, but nothing spectacular … Recovered well from a torn ACL suffered last March, but he’s had a history of injuries throughout his collegiate career, making him somewhat “injury prone.” … Not particularly quick off the dribble. His lack of an explosive first step limits his effectiveness getting past opponents and into the paint … Quicker point guards have no trouble containing him … He’s fast but needs a head of steam … Off court issues are still in back of people’s minds. Despite the fact that he’s matured, a team debating between him and another player may be inclined to pass on him due to his past indiscretions … Latral quickness is sub-par …  Notes: Has been through a lot in his college career. Price missed his entire freshman season because of a brain hemmorhage (which was nearly fatal) and then was suspended for his redshirt freshman season for stealing laptops on-campus (along with Marcus Williams) … He struggled mightily in his sophomore year and UConn finished with a 17-14 record, the worst in Jim Calhoun’s tenure … Price rebounded considerably as a junior and was a First Team All-Big East selection, but he suffered a torn ACL in UConn’s NCAA tournament opening round loss to thirteenth-seeded San Diego … Price recovered very quickly and made it back on the court for the beginning of his senior season … His numbers dipped a bit from last year (partly due to the addition of Kemba Walker and offensive emergence of Hasheem Thabeet), but don’t be fooled—he was the heart and soul of the top-ranked Huskies.Did not live up to expectations last season, but a lot of that can be attributed to rustiness after two years away from team basketball … Price did not work particularly well with the other guards on the team and lost his starting job to Craig Austrie for a small stretch towards the end of the season … His jumpshot is suspect, as he shot just 38.7% from the field, 27.3% from 3-point range, and 69% from the free throw line. He must regain his confidence and consistency … Doesn’t finish well when he gets into the lane. Often settles for runners and short jumpers when he should go strong to the basket and draw a foul … Makes good passes when he penetrates, but he spends a lot of time dribbling up top and passing the ball around the perimeter without making the defense react … Though he was in his third year of enrollment last season at UConn as a redshirt sophomore, Price was essentially a freshman. After struggling through his first year, Price will no longer be able to blame his poor play on rustiness or lack of conditioning. It is truly a make-or-break year for the former Long Island high school legend. Character questions remain to an extent after the laptop burglary incident cost him all of what should have been his freshman season 2 seasons ago.",,"Missed two straight seasons (04-05,05-06) due to a brain hemorrhage and suspension, but was regarded as one of the best high school players in the country prior to coming to UConn … Jim Calhoun said Price would have been the best player on the 30-4 2005-2006 Husky squad that included Rudy Gay, Marcus Williams, Josh Boone, Hilton Armstrong, Denham Brown, and Rashad Anderson …",,yes,,,,developed excellent longrange shooter price 27 percent 3point shooter first season uconn sophomore since increased number 41 percent equally adept catchingandshooting creating shot dribble knock difficult jumpshots taller athletic defender face get tremendous lift jumpshot help compensate lessthanstellar athleticism good solid build nba point guard 6foot2 190pounds us body well get lane improved considerably knocking floater short pullup jumpshots posse aboveaverage quickness end quick hand alert defensively price matured vocal leader uconn even play offtheball freshman kemba walker man point guard position price shout play call make sure everyone proper place real winner true warrior court,high level nba athlete quickness fine price doesnt jump particularly well hinders ability finish rim get good elevation jumpshot much tougher time shooting elite athlete play nba scoring point guard decent court vision nothing spectacular recovered well torn acl suffered last march he history injury throughout collegiate career making somewhat injury prone particularly quick dribble lack explosive first step limit effectiveness getting past opponent paint quicker point guard trouble containing he fast need head steam court issue still back people mind despite fact he matured team debating another player may inclined pas due past indiscretion latral quickness subpar note lot college career price missed entire freshman season brain hemmorhage nearly fatal suspended redshirt freshman season stealing laptop oncampus along marcus williams struggled mightily sophomore year uconn finished 1714 record worst jim calhouns tenure price rebounded considerably junior first team allbig east selection suffered torn acl uconns ncaa tournament opening round loss thirteenthseeded san diego price recovered quickly made back court beginning senior season number dipped bit last year partly due addition kemba walker offensive emergence hasheem thabeet dont fooledhe heart soul topranked huskiesdid live expectation last season lot attributed rustiness two year away team basketball price work particularly well guard team lost starting job craig austrie small stretch towards end season jumpshot suspect shot 387 field 273 3point range 69 free throw line must regain confidence consistency doesnt finish well get lane often settle runner short jumper go strong basket draw foul make good pass penetrates spends lot time dribbling top passing ball around perimeter without making defense react though third year enrollment last season uconn redshirt sophomore price essentially freshman struggling first year price longer able blame poor play rustiness lack conditioning truly makeorbreak year former long island high school legend character question remain extent laptop burglary incident cost freshman season 2 season ago,,24.03484321,3.55,85.32369338,TBD,Y,N,N,TBD,-0.9846,0
202689,Kemba Walker,2011,1,9,9,Draft,1610612766,Charlotte,Bobcats,CHA,Connecticut,College/University,1,Kemba,Walker,,,95.0,Tim Hardaway/Bobby Jackson,"Walker’s game is marked by ""electricity"" and explosiveness. Plays with an undefinable burst, seemingly moving in warp speed while everyone else is standing still- yet he remains for the most part under control, with the ball on a string. Working in his favor is a freakish blend of raw speed, breathtaking quickness, ultra-aggression and sneaky power. Scores from anywhere on the court (23.5 ppg). Can’t be contained by a single defender off the dribble, be it in the half court or most notably in transition. Splits double teams and traps in a blink. Changes direction at FULL speed. He is a master at creating space, using jab steps, cross overs and pump fakes to shed defenders. Highly creative with the rock in his hands and finishing at the rim. Able to complete plays through contact with a full head of steam. Also able to re-adjust angles and avoid shot blockers by hanging and improvising in mid-air. Constantly in attack mode, frequently living at the charity stripe (7.7 attempts). Scoop shots and floaters are not foreign to his arsenal either. Overall shooting aptitude has improved dramatically since arriving on campus. His range shooting is now a real weapon (33% on 5.5 attempts), despite a myriad of low percentage, bail out chucks. He’s always been extremely comfortable shooting step back J’s off the dribble, but displayed a new wrinkle coming off screens as the season progressed. Solid elevation and high release. Tremendous two-footed leaper in space. Despite his gift for the putting the ball in the bucket, he’s very much a facilitator (4.5 apg), creating open shots for others by commanding a second/third defender. Prolific rebounder for his size (5.4 rpg), completely unafraid to mix it up with bigger bodies. Excellent lateral quickness with fluid hips. Beats the offensive player to the spot. Opportunistic defensively- if you’re careless with the ball, he’ll take it back the other way for a deuce (1.9 stl). His motor never runs low (38 minutes per). A true winner with a warrior’s spirit.  ","His measurement of 6’1 with shoes was a win, but he remains an undersized commodity, his standing reach of 7’7.5 is the same as 5’10 PG Isaiah Thomas. Defending the new breed of NBA point guards will be a severe challenge. He takes a ton of hits in his 184-pound frame, and while he’s been anything but fragile, it’s a concern over the long haul. Walker’s an unselfish distributor and a dynamic playmaker, but he’ll never be mistaken for an orchestrator or true lead guard. Connecticut’s half court offense was largely late clock isolations: can he get a team organized and operate an NBA style, functional system? Has a tendency to play out of control times, but to his credit he has learned to pace himself when the situation calls for it (2.3 turnovers). It’s difficult to cage a lion, and as a result he will go through patches where he gets caught up in the emotion of the game. Too many out of control shot attempts, attacking the trees wildly when there’s simply nothing available. Fearless is a great quality as long as it doesn’t reach the point of reckless. Criticizing him for lack of efficiency (43% fg) is probably unfair given the tremendous burden placed upon his shoulders. Nevertheless, he does have a tendency to waste possessions. He finished in traffic at the collegiate level, but the NBA paint is a different animal. Continued advancement in the mid-range, pull up game will go a long ways in getting more quality looks and saving his body. Shooting stroke needs fine tuning, particularly from range. Arc on his jumper brings rain and inhibits consistent results.  Adam Ganeles 5/24/11Kemba’s main flaw, other than his size, seems to be his poor decision making … Occasionally takes bad shots, and forces the issue … Being under 6 feet tall at the next level will hurt him, as he may struggle to convert in traffic … Gets his shot blocked too often, a problem that will only increse at the next level if he doesn;t make an adjustment … Tends to force up shots or unrealistically attempt to draw fouls in the paint, when he should look to penetrate and kick it out … Sometimes has his mind set on his next move before he sees what’s given to him … Still turnover prone, although he plays 35 minutes per game so the ball is in his hands a lot … He lacks consistent range on his jumper, and will need to improve in that department … Defensively, he’s quick and moves well, however his lack of size at the next level will allow other guards to shoot/pass over him … Lack of strength might allow others to push him around against taller, stronger guards … Should look to add a better floater in the lane instead of penetrating in so far every time …Lack of size (he’s listed at 6-foot-1, but is probably closer to 6-feet) creates some limitations on both offense and defense … Like many young players, Walker often gets caught trying to do too much … Many of his turnovers are the result of overdribbling or making an extra pass when it is not needed … Still lacks experience and can be a bit erratic with the ball … Assist to turnover ratio is essentially 1-to-1 (2.8 assists per game and 2.7 turnovers). Needs time running the show fulltime (instead of splitting the load with AJ Price) …",,," Walker is a fast as they come, and with his aggressive style and ability to blow by practically anyone, he has potential to be a quality point guard … He will need to learn to let the game come to him better, and his size might scare off some GMs … His pull-up game, quickness and playmaking ability however can make him into an effective player, regardless of his size …Jonathan Wasserman – 3/9/10 ",yes,19.1,0.116,29.8,walker game marked electricity explosiveness play undefinable burst seemingly moving warp speed everyone else standing still yet remains part control ball string working favor freakish blend raw speed breathtaking quickness ultraaggression sneaky power score anywhere court 235 ppg cant contained single defender dribble half court notably transition split double team trap blink change direction full speed master creating space using jab step cross over pump fake shed defender highly creative rock hand finishing rim able complete play contact full head steam also able readjust angle avoid shot blocker hanging improvising midair constantly attack mode frequently living charity stripe 77 attempt scoop shot floater foreign arsenal either overall shooting aptitude improved dramatically since arriving campus range shooting real weapon 33 55 attempt despite myriad low percentage bail chuck he always extremely comfortable shooting step back j dribble displayed new wrinkle coming screen season progressed solid elevation high release tremendous twofooted leaper space despite gift putting ball bucket he much facilitator 45 apg creating open shot others commanding secondthird defender prolific rebounder size 54 rpg completely unafraid mix bigger body excellent lateral quickness fluid hip beat offensive player spot opportunistic defensively youre careless ball hell take back way deuce 19 stl motor never run low 38 minute per true winner warrior spirit,measurement 61 shoe win remains undersized commodity standing reach 775 510 pg isaiah thomas defending new breed nba point guard severe challenge take ton hit 184pound frame he anything fragile concern long haul walker unselfish distributor dynamic playmaker hell never mistaken orchestrator true lead guard connecticut half court offense largely late clock isolation get team organized operate nba style functional system tendency play control time credit learned pace situation call 23 turnover difficult cage lion result go patch get caught emotion game many control shot attempt attacking tree wildly there simply nothing available fearless great quality long doesnt reach point reckless criticizing lack efficiency 43 fg probably unfair given tremendous burden placed upon shoulder nevertheless tendency waste possession finished traffic collegiate level nba paint different animal continued advancement midrange pull game go long way getting quality look saving body shooting stroke need fine tuning particularly range arc jumper brings rain inhibits consistent result adam ganeles 52411kembas main flaw size seems poor decision making occasionally take bad shot force issue 6 foot tall next level hurt may struggle convert traffic get shot blocked often problem increse next level doesnt make adjustment tends force shot unrealistically attempt draw foul paint look penetrate kick sometimes mind set next move see whats given still turnover prone although play 35 minute per game ball hand lot lack consistent range jumper need improve department defensively he quick move well however lack size next level allow guard shootpass lack strength might allow others push around taller stronger guard look add better floater lane instead penetrating far every time lack size he listed 6foot1 probably closer 6feet creates limitation offense defense like many young player walker often get caught trying much many turnover result overdribbling making extra pas needed still lack experience bit erratic ball assist turnover ratio essentially 1to1 28 assist per game 27 turnover need time running show fulltime instead splitting load aj price,,62.02426667,1.4,86.83397334,1.600699488,N,N,N,N,-0.9743,0

His post game is predicated on brute force, but he has not really shown many reliable back-to-the-basket moves … His motor might also be an issue as he gets winded fairly quickly, but it could just be the lack of conditioning … He has stretches where he completely disappears, at times he doesn’t even try to make an effort to run down the floor … He does not add much in rebounding department, as he lacks desire to attack the glass…Cousins is very raw.

Good hands and stays alert … Covers a lot of ground defensively and good help defender. Very good shot blocker with his timing, length, and athleticism. Closes out and blocks jump shooters better than many players you will find at this level.

Needs to further develop his footwork both on the perimeter and in the post … While he has shown some shot blocking and defensive potential, the fact that he’s not a legit 7 footer draws into question whether his rim protecting/shot blocking ability will translate to the next level … Needs to put additional weight on, and there is some concern regarding how adding weight may affect his mobility and athleticism …Needs work overall on developing ball skills and isn’t always heavily involved with the offense … Solid shooting form and does show hope of being able to stretch the floor but the consistency isn’t there yet.

A lot of his scoring comes from rim running … Has a slight frame and very thin lower body, lacks strength … Needs to stay out of foul trouble. Saw limited minutes in a few of Spire’s games due to picking up fouls early. Bites on pump fakes and tries to block shots that he should look to contest … Despite his tools and standing out as an offensive rebounder, he doesn’t separate himself like you would think as a rebounder overall.

a rim protector and shooter give him solid intrigue … Jackson projects to be an excellent defensive big that disrupts opposing offenses … He should ultimately be able to become a good pick and roll

pick and pop threat as well, although he will likely be more of a driving threat than a jump shooter in the pick and pop game … He has limited offensive repertoire, but proved to be a defensive game

PG skills in a 6-8 forward body, can play all the back-court spots. Has great fundamentals for his age, drives well and know how to create his own shot or pass the ball. Offensively he can do almost everything at the best level possible for a 16 year old. Great 3p shot, has shooting range of more than 24 feet and likes to show it off. Even if Gallinari seems a streak shooter sometimes, he is definitely a true shooter who doesn’t miss twice if left open and is able to shoot even from the dribble. His ball-handling is very strong for a man of his height. He can drive to the basket from left and right with a good first step and often tryes finishing with a dunk in traffic. Plays decently in the low post. Above average rebounder for the role. Good ball-hawk thanks to his quick hands. Reads the defense well so he’s able to receive a lot of fouls and go to the FT line many times per game. Plays with intensity and heart. Natural born talent with intriguing upside: at 6-8 probably hasn’t finished growing (has long legs not proportioned to the rest of body).","A high level European player does not always equal a contributor in the NBA His body has ways to go before it will be on the NBA level Athleticism and explosiveness are just average Struggles dribbling the ball against physical defenders which hurts even more considering his blow by ability is limited His secondary moves off the dribble are subpar and he is often forced to shoot difficult and offbalance shots Tends to dribble the ball high and even looks down on it as he is attacking, hurting his court vision and decision making Has minimal elevation on his jumpshot, he is more of a set shooter and his release is very robotic and lacks fluidness His legs are stiff which makes his movements seem a bit awkward and it takes away from his quickness While he has good height, he is strictly a perimeter player as he has minimal back to the basket moves and his weak frame also makes him a non threat in the post His rebounding numbers are only decent, for a player at his position, getting major minutes, they should be higher Defensively he is a liability; he gambles too much, plays with his hands down and is undisciplined Marginal foot speed and a weak body will leave his opponents salivating in excitement to abuse the mismatchLast year doctors stopped him from playing for 3 months due to a growth problem. Now he seems ok but has to improve physically and then add muscles to his body. Sometimes struggles with his shot selection and has the tendency to rely on his 3pt jumper too much. Nothing special on defense, except for steals: often has difficulty defending shorter and quicker opponents. Must become quicker with his footwork and lateral mobility. Needs to improve his decision making and develop his promising passing skills.

little-to-no range on his jump shot … Doesn’t excel on the defensive glass like he does on the offensive glass because his box-out technique isn’t great, even though the athleticism and strength are there … Though his improved conditioning has helped, Johnson is not particularly athletic or quick and can get caught rotating over too slowly on defense or getting left behind in transition … Also is not much of an above-the-rim player despite his size … Fairly foul-prone, limiting his effectiveness as a defender … Poor free-throw shooter.  Though he raised his percentage from 45% to 63% from his freshman to sophomore year, his mechanics are still poor and he still connects at a very low rate … Despite his size, he’s not great defensively.  Tends to get caught out of position and his length

Shamet has become one of the best lead guards in the nation this year … He has ideal size for the point guard position in the NBA at at 6-4 with long arms … He is not the most explosive athlete, but he has a very high basketball IQ for a player his age and makes great decisions with the ball … As a freshman, Shamet posted a three to one assist to turnover ratio for the season.  ..While that has gone down slightly this year due to an increased workload, he is still averaging an outstanding 2.5 assists to one turnover … He always plays the game under control and commands the offense exceptionally well … Shamet has the ability to play at several different speeds with the ball in his hands and gets his teammates the ball in rhythm and where they can make plays … He is also terrific in pick-and-roll situations, where he ranks in the 79th percentile as a pick-and-roll ball handler because of his ability to make plays for others while not getting sped up … Shamet has proven to be a versatile offensive player, making the switch from shooting guard to point guard last year … While primarily used as a point guard at Wichita State, he is a very efficient offensive player off the ball as well, as he ranks third in college basketball in points per possession (1.521) off of spot-up situations (100th percentile) … In an NBA that particularly emphasizes offensive versatility nowadays, Shamet’s ability to play both on and off the ball at a high level will serve him quite well … He is a good passer, but the skill that will best translate to the NBA is his shooting ability … His size allows him to shoot over the top of smaller guards, and he has a beautiful mid-range pull-up jump-shot, which cannot be said about most college guards … He shoots 45.5 percent on half-court jump shots and is a threat to score from anywhere on the floor … Shamet is also lethal from three-point territory with range out to the NBA line … He is shooting 44 percent from three this season, the second consecutive year that he has shot over 41 percent from downtown … He is also a very good free throw shooter, having recorded two straight seasons with at least an 80 percent clip … Despite underwhelming athleticism, he is crafty, picks his spots wisely and is surprisingly an excellent finisher at the rim (59.1 percent) …","While he does in large part make up for it with his high-IQ and skill, Shamet’s lack of burst off the dribble will limit his upside at the next level … At the college level, it does not hinder him that often, but in the NBA he will be up against much more explosive and skilled guards every single night … Shamet also still has some developing to do, physically, in order to reach his full potential … He will need to add some strength and muscle in order for him to endure a full NBA season and withstand the physicality of the pro game … While he is a very good finisher at the basket in college, it will be much more difficult to replicate in the NBA without him adding a few pounds of muscle, especially since he does not have elite explosiveness to compensate for it … There will also be questions about what to do with Shamet defensively at the next level … While he has the size and length to challenge point guards, he struggles to stay in front of quicker players … He may have to be a guy that relies on his length to come up with steals and blocks in order to at least be semi-productive on the defensive end … However, forcing turnovers or contesting shots has never been a true strength of his … Shamet has also had multiple foot injuries throughout his career, so there may be concerns of whether that will continue to be an issue going forward …",,"Landry Shamet is another great example of how Wichita State has remained an elite basketball program over the last few years … Head coach Gregg Marshall has elevated Wichita State to national prominence by luring in underrated players like Shamet and transforming them into NBA prospects and college basketball stars … Attended Park Hill High School in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was a student in the Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID) college preparatory program … Played just three games in freshman season before having to redshirt the season due to a foot injury … First-team All-AAC (2018) … First-team All-MVC (2017) and MVC Freshman of the Year

big man prospect in this entire draft when healthy, something he hasn’t been in quite a while … Looks the part of an NBA big man with his frame … An explosive leaper even with the injuries to his knees …  He’s got great hands which allows him to finish around the rim and in traffic …  He runs the floor well for a big man and is active on the glass … Shows a lot of physicality in the post and doesn’t shy away from contact on defense … Takes contact in the chest, isn’t easily moved off of his spots and is an above average rim protector … Moves his feet extremely well and has really good lateral quickness for a big man … Can play both the PF and C positions in the NBA from a defensive standpoint and while he is a work in progress on the offensive end, he has exhibited an ability to use a variety of post moves to score in the paint … Before his injury, he excelled in a face up game from about 15 feet and used his superior quickness, length and athleticism to get to the rim and finish with a purpose … The consensus top overall player in his class for years while in high , Giles has everything an NBA scout/GM could want from a prospect physically … A tremendous kid with a extremely outgoing and likable personality …","Multiple knee surgeries including two ACL tears (both knees) and an MCL tear (left) before graduating high school is a huge question mark with regards to the outlook of Giles’ career.  No team wants to draft the next Greg Oden and players with injury histories like that of Giles always raise red flags to scouts and GM’s who are putting their jobs on the line with every draft pick and free agent signing …  His ability to explode with contact seemed affected … As far as Giles’ looks on the court, he seemed to get lost at times during his freshman season and was almost afraid to do certain things … Whether that was simply due to a fear of another injury, lack of conditioning, Duke’s struggles in developing bigs, or an awareness thing remains to be seen … He isn’t a versatile player on offense and doesn’t really possess the range that you would like to see out of a PF even though that was always was he projected to be during his days in high school …  Doesn’t have great footwork or great touch on offense and relies heavily on put backs and dunks for most of his points …  His jumper is one glaring hole in his game as he routinely air balled or barely drew iron once outside of about 12 feet …  Doesn’t make great decisions on offense and hasn’t really learned to simply play within himself just yet …  Overall: Giles’ freshman season wasn’t what most had hoped it would be …  He had a hard time getting into shape post knee surgeries and never really carved out the type of roll that you would have hoped for a player with his skill set …  His 3.9 point and 3.8 rebound averages are more synonymous with a player who would likely go undrafted as opposed to one that is likely to go in the first round.  There were definitely flashes of the player that he used to be but he was never really fully healed during his time at Duke … Will have to learn to trust his knees and believe that he is healthy before he will make an impact at the next level … Would likely have been the #1 overall pick this year if it weren’t for the impact his injuries had on his senior year in high school and freshman year with the Blue Devils … His feel for the game was off during the year but he gets a pass in my book due to the fact that he was getting acclimated to high level college basketball after missing so much time due to injuries over the previous three years … If Giles’ injuries are a thing of the past and he can stay healthy then he could be the steal of the draft if he falls into the late teens to early 20’s.",,"Measured 6′ 9.25”

His game is marked by both power and skill. Legitimate low block scorer often working his way into a high quality look (17.5 PPG on 52% FG). Master of positioning at 280 pounds and establishes early. Uses his wide body and derriere to keep defenders locked onto his hip. Tremendous lower body strength pinning his opponents into submission. Aggressively throws his weight around and unafraid to punish those in his path. Thrives on contact. Wide array of post moves on the low block, finishing over either shoulder with either hand. Footwork and understanding of angles are advanced. Soft hands and a feathery touch. Nimble elusivity for his size. He has taken strides in the face-up game, working from the elbow area in space without threat of a double. He’s a dual threat from there, either comfortably popping a mid-range jumper or attacking off the bounce with skilled handle. Quickness is not his ally, but he’s a bull in a china shop. Technically sound jump shot with smooth release. Range has extended to three-point territory, shooting 40% on over 1 attempt per game last season. 77% shooter at the free throw stripe, to which he is a frequent visitor. Strong basketball IQ- reads double teams, finds the open man and rarely get careless with the ball (1.2 AST: 1.9 TO). Excellent anticipation on the glass, clears room with his big frame (9 RPG, 3 Offensive). Intuitive defender with good hands (1.2 steals). Averaged a shade over a block per game last year, a healthy upgrade from 0.5 as a freshman. Added muscle weight and improved conditioning that resulted in more effective minutes at full strength, as well as more explosive movements.Sullinger has decent size for a post player measuring 6’9” (in shoes) with a 6’11.5” wingspan … He is a bruising throwback post player that uses his 286 pound body to create angles for his shot and to clear space on the boards … Very physical player that uses his body to wear down opposing big men…The Ohio State commit is also very skilled with a repertoire of advanced post moves for a high school player…Comfortable finishing around the rim with either hand … Has excellent hands and footwork and shows very good touch around the basket … Solid rebounder, he attacks the glass at both ends of the floor and creates offensive opportunities off of putbacks…Shows decent form and touch on the 12-18 footer … Passes well out of the post … He’s a winner, leading his Columbus Northland squad to an Ohio Divison 1 state championship and his All-Ohio Red AAU squad to three consecutive National Championships …  Weaknesses: Does not possess elite athleticism…Is prone to having his shot blocked and has some difficulty with longer athletic defenders…Does not run the floor extremely well…Shows ability, but needs to improve consistency of mid-range jumper…Lateral quickness is lacking, creating defensive mismatches versus perimeter oriented PFs…Is not a particularly dominant defensive player due to lack of explosiveness and quickness…Weight could be a long-term issue, not a particularly solid 262 pounds…Potential one-and-done lottery guy, but must improve conditioning and mid-range game and show that he can dominate at the college level …","Lacks the overall physical gifts of other top prospects in the draft class. Appears stuck in glue at times, particularly against long, athletic competition. His space-creating advantage and wide base are nullified. No elevation off the floor and severely limited explosion. Plays beneath the rim. Run the courts laboriously. Lateral quickness is poor- badly exposed in space and on pick and roll switches. Undersized for the center position, a shortcoming he does not make up for in length. Major concerns defensively against new breed, mobile NBA 4’s. Not an intimidating presence on the back line of a defense. Less than a blocked shot per game in conference play, and does not alter attempts either. Averaged more steals than blocks. Position defender. He’s overwhelmed by size, length and athleticism on both sides of the ball. The majority of his dominant efforts came against lesser competition and teams devoid of frontline size. His 5/19 performance in his final collegiate game against Kansas did not aid his draft standing. His body style will always be susceptible to weight issues. Can’t afford to rest on his laurels and be satisfied with current level of conditioning and agility if he wants to remain in the lottery.",,NBA doctors redflagged his back at the NBA combine. It has severely damaged his draft stock and he’s no longer considered a lock for the first round. (added 6/24)Measured 6’10 with a 7’1 wingspan at the 2011 Amare Skills Academy.

both inside and out …  Has a sweet jump shot with deep range – good elevation and a quick release …  Though mostly a spot-up shooter, he’s dangerous off the dribble and off screens in catch-and-shoot situations … Uses step-back and fade-away moves very effectively … Makes overly aggressive on-the-ball defenders pay with a quick first step to the basket … With a sturdy build and a 37-inch vertical, he has no trouble getting to the rim and finishing through contact … Draws a lot of fouls, and is an excellent free-throw shooter …  Terrific finisher in transition … Doesn’t have a flashy handle, but is relatively good at protecting the ball … Played some as a stretch 4 at North Carolina, and while he won’t do that in the NBA, the solidly built youngster has the potential to expand his game as a post-up guard … When motivated, has active hands and comes up with a fair amount of steals … Does not lack for confidence …   Weaknesses:  Due to a combination of a lack of effort, a lack of awareness, and below-average speed and quickness, Hairston is a poor defender … In one-on-one situations, he is often abused by quicker players on both cuts and drives to the basket … As team defender, he is often in the wrong place at the wrong time – he doesn’t always rotate, and when he does, he has poor recovery speed. Also, at times, he inexplicably steps away from the action, as if he is playing with five fouls or playing for the Washington Generals … Appears undisciplined, lackadaisical – doesn’t make a lot of hustle plays, stands around a lot on offense, and often jogs down the floor on defense … An offensive black hole – once he gets the ball, it is never seen again … Averaged just .8 assists per game in the D-league this past season … His confidence can work against him as he appears to think that he’s a stronger talent than he is, leading to questionable work ethic, and possible trouble accepting a secondary role on a team … Body language while at UNC early in the season was, to be blunt, atrocious …    Notes: Hairston had one standout season at North Carolina (2012-13), leading the team in scoring with 14.6 points per game and finishing with 89 three-pointers, the second-most in a season by a Tar Heel.  He made nearly 40 percent of his three-point attempts that season …  This past season, he finished fourth in the D-league in scoring, averaging 21.8 points per game, playing for Texas.  He made 36 percent of his three pointers and 87 percent of his free throws … Disappointed in the shooting drills at the NBA Combine, with some observers commenting on his casual approach …  Hairston was dismissed from UNC due to a series of off-court incidents.  Between May and July of 2013, he was twice cited for speeding, citied once for driving without a license, and charged with possession of marijuana. A gun was also found outside his rental car. To make matters worse, on two of the occasions, he was driving cars leased by a known felon, which prompted the NCAA to launch an investigation into improper benefits…     Outlook: Assuming that he has learned from his mistakes, Hairston should at least enjoy an NBA career as a scorer/3-point specialist off the bench … If he improves his overall effort and play on the defensive end, his prospects would be much brighter, though it is very doubtful that he would ever become an All-Star-level player due to his average athletic ability … A borderline first-round selection who will likely fall into the second due to his past indiscretions … ","  Due to a combination of a lack

was a defensive force when he was on the floor for Louisville … With a 7’2.75” wingspan and over 9’0” standing reach, along with weighing in at 245 lbs, measures in at around or above average for a post … Moves feet quite well for a big man and covers a lot of ground on defense … Load to move down low, showed improvement as a post player … Will make rim runs, has a decent stride to him and definitely has the strength to battle inside, along with potential to increase his already impressive girth … Was a valuable rim protector, shows good timing as a shot blocker and is quite good at playing with his arms straight up … Also had a pretty nice steal rate for a big man, makes a lot of plays defensively … Factor on the offensive boards, works hard and knows how to use his body … Willing to do a lot of the things you want your big man to do, to the point of shooting FT’s underhanded in hopes of improvement, as he went from 46.7% FT as a freshman to 58.9% FT as a sophomore … While his hands are not very big at his size, does have a quick reaction time, which enables him to do things faster than most centers … Showed very nice vision, which makes up for his limitations as a shooter and lack of creativity as a post player … Also a strong defensive rebounder, closes out possessions to go along with knowledge of how to alter shots without getting moved far out of position … Ability to make decisions on the move sets him apart from a vast number of young big men … Finished a high amount of his attempts near the rim … His ability in the pick-and-roll, playing off the ball, also show signs of being a good teammate … Still only 19-years old, does not turn 20 until November and already possesses strength that sets him apart","Quite limited offensively, has not shown much ability to stretch the floor or post moves … Lacks speed to do much off of the dribble or the footwork to consistently pose much of an issue once he has the ball on the block … Plays very upright, which sometimes causes him to get pushed off balance … Still a rather poor FT shooter, who did not get to the line very often … With the NBA now leaning towards the “hack-a-whoever” mode, will still be a possible liability on the floor offensively … Will gamble and make some bad decisions as a passer, very high turnover rate given his usage rate … Gambles and uses his hands a lot as a defender, resulting in foul trouble on quite a number of occasions … Not an explosive leaper, will likely have a much more difficult time finishing and challenging at the rim in the NBA … Conditioning will be something he needs to develop in the NBA, can lose some focus when he is tired … While he runs alright, still not particularly fast and will have a tough time staying in front of quicker players … Measured with only 8.00” hand width, among the smallest at the NBA Draft Combine in 2016 … Averaged only 7 FGA’s per game and played just 24.6 mpg, expecting him to do much more than that will take quite a while … Was not cleared to begin private workouts with teams close to the NBA Draft Combine as it was discovered he had a heart rhythm issue known as “Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome”, which required surgery and will definitely be something that should be monitored",,"Brother of former Syracuse and pro player, Arinze Onuaku … Name is pronounced chih-NAH-noo on-ooh-AHH-koo … Helped

Finishes above the rim often and with good explosion & power, and shows promise converting through contact despite his thin frame (52 FG% inside the arc) … More of a face-up player than a true post-up guy, and has enough quickness to beat bigger players off the bounce with his 1st step … Decisive, unselfish decision-maker who takes what the defense gives him when it’s time to score or as a passer (1.4/1.4 A/TO) … Equipped with a soft touch and range out to the 3-point line (39 3FG% on over 4 3FGA), and is a knockdown shooter with his feet set particularly in and around the corners … Shouldn’t have many problems getting his shots off with his height and high release point … Not bad in the mid-post area either, and shows flashes of a turnaround jumper over his left shoulder … Can also extend and score over smaller forwards in the low post with his right-hand jump hook … Has good hands and a seemingly wide catch radius to snag inaccurate passes … Active player who competes hard and makes hustle plays; will work to get himself some easy points by cutting off the ball and crashing the offensive glass (2.4 ORPG) … Has potential as a screen-and-roll threat … Runs the floor like a deer and it’s easy to project him being an asset as a rim running scoring threat in transition … Has been outstanding defensively as a Fr., particularly off the ball, showing excellent overall instincts and timing as a rim protector (1.7 BPG) … Must be located by offensive players when slashing to the paint … Pretty rangy and can cover ground quickly to rotate and erase if his teammates get beat … Also does a really good job of positioning his arms straight up and keeping the shots he blocks in play, even when he makes emphatic rejections … Moves his feet well laterally and projects to be able to switch and guard on the perimeter nicely too;

tendency to force or settle for long shots instead of attacking defenders … Has only one move in the post, will need to develop his repertoire further to have success on the low block at the next

His free throw attempts per game do not do justice to his willingness to create contact and finish through it at the rim … Covers a lot of ground with his step back jumper, allowing him to get his shot up from the mid-range or 3-point arc over lengthier defenders … Converted many of these fallaway jumpers on his way to a 17.7 point average in his final season in Happy Valley … High-level patience with the ball in his hand … Gritty player who scraps for rebounds (7.4 per game) and elevates the play of his teammates with his tenacity and leadership … Capable of a triple-double on any night in college with his well-rounded play.

the dribble … Has solid size for either guard position … Recently measured 6’5"" in shoes with a 6’7"" wingspan … Very quick with the ball in his hands … Has an extremely quick first step and the ball-handling ability to take advantage of it … Solid athlete, though he isn’t the type to play above the rim … Is more of a long jumper than a high jumper … Surprisingly adaptive in the air … Shows good body control despite smallish frame … Confident shooter with range that extends beyond the NBA three-point line … Quick trigger on the perimeter and doesn’t need a lot of space to get a good shot off … Shoots very well off the dribble or out of the triple-threat position … Very smooth ball-handling ability … Tough to stop in isolation situations … Excels at breaking down defenses with sharp and consecutive changes in speed and/or direction … Chases contact … Gets opposing big men in foul trouble and shoots a decent amount of free-throws (5.4 free-throws attempted per game) … Plays very well in pick-and-roll situations … Knows how to read and exploit the reactions of screened defenders … Is not afraid of pressure situations … Burned North Carolina earlier in the season with a deep game-winning three-pointer over the outstretched arm of center Tyler Zeller … Supremely confident … Plays with intensity on the floor … Can be an effective defender when he actually gets low in his stance and bodies-up his man … It isn’t uncommon to see him dramatically improve his defensive posture (and subsequently, his defensive effectiveness) late in close games … Comes from an NBA family … Father is ex-NBA point guard and current NBA coach Doc Rivers …   Weaknesses: Is highly ball-dominant … Will likely need a team to be tailored around his ability to create off the dribble in order to play up to his potential offensively … Not a true point guard … Can get over-aggressive and mistake-prone at times when looking to get to the basket … Averaged 2.3 turnovers per game during his freshman season at Duke, against only 2.1 assists … While he can penetrate with the best of them, he currently lacks the sheer vision of a primary facilitator … Has done a good job of adding muscle to his thin frame, but needs to continue to become stronger … While he’s a creative finisher, he also has a tendency to rush shots around the rim … Shot 65.8% from the stripe, which is a very disappointing number for somebody that creates as much contact as Rivers does … Effort is usually underwhelming defensively … Doesn’t collect a ton of steals … Has been criticized for having a bit of an ego, though many people believe that this added confidence makes him a more dangerous player …   Overall: Rivers is an exciting prospect and a potentially electric offensive player at the next level … However, there are a number of concerns about his ability to adapt to the NBA … He hasn’t yet proven that he can be an effective player without dominating the ball and he hasn’t yet shown the vision that most teams would feel comfortable with in a starting point guard … A team in the lottery will most likely be willing to take a chance on him though, regardless of his positional concerns …Rivers is a 6’4 guard with enough size and length (6’7 wingspan) to function as both a PG and a SG … A good athlete, with excellent fluidity and agility, and adequate explosiveness, speed, and quickness … Really good at changing speeds, and displays more of a smooth, controlled game than most players his age … Great 1st step … Shows sound ball-handling skills, and has few problems creating for himself off the bounce … A natural scorer … Able to score at all 3 levels very well …Very good shooting skills, with NBA range already … Is a threat to make jumpshots off the dribble from as far as 25 feet, which is intriguing … Plays with aggressiveness, and is a playmaker with the ball in his hands … Clever finisher around the rim, who utilizes reverses and the net and rim to shield shot-blockers from the ball … Uses floaters and pull-up jumpers well when cut off by defenders before he makes it all the way to the hoop … Can score in bunches, and is fearless about getting his shots up … Pretty good pick and roll player … Can certainly play up-tempo, and fits well in an offense that runs … Also good in isolation, as a threat to shoot, pull-up, or get in the paint … Not bad basic passing skills, and will find teammates if the D collapses on him … Can get steals on D and isn’t afraid of jumping in the passing lanes … Enjoyed an outstanding HS career, and scouts have been keeping an eye on him virtually since he was a Soph. in HS … Has a very strong pedigree with his father, Doc, being one of the elite head coaches in the NBA with the Boston Celtics … Reportedly has a good work ethic, and he has put on considerable weight and gotten stronger over the past year","Although Rivers is very aggressive, he also can be selfish and ball-dominant at times … Prone to pounding the ball and overdribbling looking for his shots … Often demonstrates poor shot selection, shooting shots out of range of normal offense or under duress … Is also used to trying to shoot himself out of slumps, and settling for contested jumpers off the dribble … Physically, Rivers is pretty mediocre for an NBA guard … He’s a bit of a tweener guard, although he’s more of a SG and has enough size to play there … Doesn’t show great floor vision, and often looks to pass as a last resort … At times, Rivers will pout and show bad body language on the court. He’s developed a bit of a prima donna attitude which hopefully will change as he matures … A fairly nondescript defender, who hasn’t been known to compete hard on that end … His potential on D is also limited …",,"Measured 6’5 (in shoes) 203 lbs, with a 6’7 wingspan at the 2011 Kevin Durant Skills Academy."," Rivers is an exciting prospect and a potentially electric offensive player at the next level … However, there are a number of concerns about his ability to adapt to the NBA … He hasn’t yet proven that he can be an effective player without dominating the ball and he hasn’t yet shown the vision that most teams would feel comfortable with in a starting point guard … A team in the lottery will most likely be willing to take a chance on him though, regardless of his positional concerns …Tyler Ingle 6/14/12",yes,9.7,0.043,-4.5,dynamic scorer effortlessly create offense dribble solid size either guard position recently measured 65 shoe 67 wingspan quick ball hand extremely quick first step ballhandling ability take advantage solid athlete though isnt type play rim long jumper high jumper surprisingly adaptive air show good body control despite smallish frame confident shooter range extends beyond nba threepoint line quick trigger perimeter doesnt need lot space get good shot shoot well dribble triplethreat position smooth ballhandling ability tough stop isolation situation excels breaking defense sharp consecutive change speed andor direction chase contact get opposing big men foul trouble shoot decent amount freethrows 54 freethrows attempted per game play well pickandroll situation know read exploit reaction screened defender afraid pressure situation burned north carolina earlier season deep gamewinning threepointer outstretched arm center tyler zeller supremely confident play intensity floor effective defender actually get low stance bodiesup man isnt uncommon see dramatically improve defensive posture subsequently defensive effectiveness late close game come nba family father exnba point guard current nba coach doc river weakness highly balldominant likely need team tailored around ability create dribble order play potential offensively true point guard get overaggressive mistakeprone time looking get basket averaged 23 turnover per game freshman season duke 21 assist penetrate best currently lack sheer vision primary facilitator done good job adding muscle thin frame need continue become stronger he creative finisher also tendency rush shot around rim shot 658 stripe disappointing number somebody creates much contact river effort usually underwhelming defensively doesnt collect ton steal criticized bit ego though many people believe added confidence make dangerous player overall river exciting prospect potentially electric offensive player next level however number concern ability adapt nba hasnt yet proven effective player without dominating ball hasnt yet shown vision team would feel comfortable starting point guard team lottery likely willing take chance though regardless positional concern river 64 guard enough size length 67 wingspan function pg sg good athlete excellent fluidity agility adequate explosiveness speed quickness really good changing speed display smooth controlled game player age great 1st step show sound ballhandling skill problem creating bounce natural scorer able score 3 level well good shooting skill nba range already threat make jumpshots dribble far 25 foot intriguing play aggressiveness playmaker ball hand clever finisher around rim utilizes revers net rim shield shotblockers ball us floater pullup jumper well cut defender make way hoop score bunch fearless getting shot pretty good pick roll player certainly play uptempo fit well offense run also good isolation threat shoot pullup get paint bad basic passing skill find teammate collapse get steal isnt afraid jumping passing lane enjoyed outstanding h career scout keeping eye virtually since soph h strong pedigree father doc one elite head coach nba boston celtic reportedly good work ethic put considerable weight gotten stronger past year,although river aggressive also selfish balldominant time prone pounding ball overdribbling looking shot often demonstrates poor shot selection shooting shot range normal offense duress also used trying shoot slump settling contested jumper dribble physically river pretty mediocre nba guard he bit tweener guard although he sg enough size play doesnt show great floor vision often look pas last resort time river pout show bad body language court he developed bit prima donna attitude hopefully change matures fairly nondescript defender hasnt known compete hard end potential also limited,,34.88424581,1.45,50.58215642,-0.144336647,N,Y,MID,Y,-0.8359,0

His standing reach makes dunking effortless for him … Scores a lot on ally oops and garbage baskets … Displays decent upside with his size, strength, mobility and athleticism … Has shot blocking ability with his long arms and leaping abilility and the potential to be a solid inside presence … Appears to have solid hands grabbing rebounds and catching the ball … Shows some touch on his shot, giving his offensive game promise …","Really not much of a skilled player on the offensive end, and will likely always be a 5th option on the floor … Is a bit too mechanical in and out of his moves and will be contested very easily until he improves that … Keeps things simple on offense, but is sometimes painfully predictable with his moves … Seems to preconceive what he will do with the ball as soon as he gets it without reading the action around him … Has that bad habit many young bigmen do of putting the ball lower than his chest when he gets offensive rebounds or receives entry passes, allowing quick handed guards to get steals or knock the ball free … Needs most of his shots created for him … Doesn’t always play as strong as his imposing size indicates, and can struggle to finish with contact at times … Doesn’t have great hands, and will bobble passes at times that hit his hands … Not a great rebounder, which is concerning for his size … Will have to show that he can play outside of the paint in an NBA that has a defensive 3 second rule … Was able to plant in the paint playing in the Cuse zone and rarely strayed from the immediate paint area, and will have to adjust to a more pick and roll style NBA … Although he runs the floor as well as he can for his size, he still is a lumbering kind of big who is best suited for a team who doesn’t play up-tempo … There are still questions about his conditioning after a forgettable freshman season in which he was sluggish and out of shape for most of the year … Has the frame and physique that needs to be conditioned constantly, as he can get out of shape fairly quickly if he isn’t careful … Has some concerns that will come up during the interview and character evaluation process, including a domestic violence charge and being academically ineligible for the NCAA tournament as a sophomore … At times is a bit hotheaded on the court, getting on himself or the refs too heavily when he makes mistakes … A bit foul prone, but is doing a better job of going straight up when blocking shots … Poor foul line shooter … Has a raw basketball IQ, and is clearly still learning the game …Weaknesses:  Fab has the size and length you look for in a prospect at the center position, however he’s raw and will need to work on every offensive aspect of his game … He has some basic post moves, but the fluidity/explosiveness in his execution is too slow at the moment …Will need to work on developing more in depth post moves to become more of an offensive threat … He’s not the greatest athlete, and can get lost in an offensive set as he adjusts to playing in a faster and more up-tempo game …A project. Despite the lack of quality bigs, it’s unlikely that he can be a one and done lottery pick type of college player.

6-foot-9, 257-pound O’Bryant looks the part of an NBA power forward …  A versatile interior scorer, O’Bryant improved his scoring average and shooting percentage in each of his three seasons at LSU …  A triple-threat offensively – can score off the drive, in the post, or from midrange with his jumper.  Uses a variety of impressive spin moves in the post, can make hook shots and layups with either hand, and has a midrange fade-away that is difficult to defend … The range on his jump shot extends past 22 feet, though he is far more reliable inside 15 feet … According to Hoop-Math.com, O’Bryant made 69 percent of his shots at the rim and 40 percent of his two-point jumpers this past season, both above-average numbers …  Effectively uses his sturdy body – not easily moved in the post, not fazed by contact, and draws a good number of fouls (7.3 FTA per 40 minutes this past season) …  Has active hands and a nose for the ball …  Sets solid screens …  A solid rebounder, especially on the offensive end of the floor …  Motivated, involved, coachable, and levelheaded …  Showed steady physical and mental improvement throughout his career at LSU … Transformed his body between sophomore and junior seasons and is moving much better with the new, svelte body … Appears to have the length and strength to play both PF and center at the NBA level …    Weaknesses: Turnover prone – averaged 4.3 turnovers per 40 minutes this past season …  Often reacts too slowly to double teams, and throws errant passes or travels as a result …  Doesn’t have an explosive first step, and has trouble beating his man off the dribble …  Sometimes overestimates his dribble/drive skills and finds himself with no place to go with the ball, with the end result being a turnover or a forced shot … Does not block many shots, not so much because he’s vertically challenged but because he is not aggressive in terms of challenging shots…  Not overly physical on either end of the floor, and sometimes falls in love with his finesse game on the offensive end…  Has below-average speed and doesn’t score much in transition … Can finish with authority, but doesn’t do it as often as he should … Not a great foul shooter, making fewer than 64 percent of his attempts … Conditioning could be better – needs to convert some of his baby fat into muscle … Playing at the 5 spot in college, he is not a tested perimeter defender…   Notes: Measured 6’9 (with shoes) 260 lbs with a 7’1.5 wingspan at the 2013 Nike Big Man Skills Academy … As a junior at LSU, O’Bryant was the focal point of the offense, seemingly touching the ball on every possession.  When he was not on the floor, the Tigers’ offense frequently struggled … This past season, he shot 49.6 percent from the floor, averaged 15.4 points and 7.7 rebounds per game, and was named to the All-SEC First-Team for the second straight season … One of just 14 players in LSU history to finish his career with more than 1,000 points and 700 rebounds … In three games against Kentucky’s vaunted frontline this past season, he averaged 22.3 points and 9.3 rebounds per contest …  Was not overly impressive at the NBA Combine, finishing near the bottom in both the shuttle (3.32) and sprint (3.45) drills, and registering one of the higher body fat percentages (10.75%).  On the plus side, he posted solid vertical numbers – 31 inches standing and 35.5 inches with a running start …  According to his agent, Gerald Collier, O’Bryant has worked out for Atlanta, Phoenix, San Antonio, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, and Minnesota.  He is scheduled to work out for Houston, Miami, Charlotte, Milwaukee, Memphis, Toronto, Detroit and possibly one more team …   Outlook: O’Bryant has the potential to become a very effective scoring PF at the NBA level.  Unlike many of the other big men in this draft, he can score both inside and out … His weaknesses are correctable, and he has been focusing on improving in these areas this offseason.  His explosiveness, both vertically and horizontally, could simply be improved by continuing to increase his conditioning and by adding more muscle.  To become an outstanding offensive player, he also needs to tighten his handle, make better decisions, and improve his shooting consistency beyond 15 feet … On the other end of the floor, it’s unlikely that he will ever play at an elite level – he’s not tall enough to consistently defend pro centers, and he’s not quick enough to reliably stay with agile power forwards on the perimeter … O’Bryant appears to be a lock to be drafted at least in the second round, and if he impresses in his private workouts, he has an outside chance to be taken at the end of the first round …"," Turnover prone – averaged 4.3 turnovers per 40 minutes this past

out well with his muscular frame, and gets a lot of putback baskets for himself…Dawson is a versatile defender, who, in college, could guard three or four positions, and while he may be more limited defensively in the pros, his strength and solid length (6’11"" wingspan) allows him to guard post players and his athleticism allows him to defend on the perimeter to an extent…As a power forward, Dawson has enough of a face-up game to be effective offensively.  Can attack the basket against slower defenders and has a nice little turnaround jumper within 10 feet.  Shot an excellent 54% from the field last season…Strong finisher at the basket, especially in transition, where he converted on 75% of his attempts…Fairly explosive athlete who has shown the ability to finish above the rim…Has an

poorly, and really disappears from games.  Has scored 7 or fewer points 15 different times in the past two seasons despite being a big part of the Spartans’ offense.  Peak Dawson would be a near-lock to hear his name on draft day.  But Dawson isn’t always playing at his peak and it could cost him…Physically, Dawson is a bit of a tweener.  He’s strong, smart, and tenacious, but he’s still only a 6’7"" power forward.  Suffered a knee injury early in his college career, and never seemed to fully rebound to the elite athlete he was prior… At the combine, he posted the lowest lane agility time of any player, indicating that he lacks the lateral quickness to consistently guard the small forward position at the NBA level.  His defensive versatility won’t be nearly as much of an asset at the next level…Lacks shooting range.  Didn’t hit a single three-pointer in college (out of 8 attempts), which currently limits him from playing the 3…Awful free throw shooter. 49% from the stripe this season…Limited lateral quickness may hamper him when defending the pick-and-roll…Posted the second-slowest shuttle run speed at the combine.  Slow to accelerate, which will further hamper him defensively…For a guy looking to be an NBA power forward, Dawson’s post game is very limited.  In the pros, he won’t be able to rely on his strength to overpower defenders, and he doesn’t have many moves at all to get looks at the rim…",,Named Second Team All-Big Ten and First Team All-Big Ten defender…," Dawson is undoubtedly a tweener forward, but his strength, smarts, motor, and athleticism

prefers to face the basket almost exclusively … Budding playmaking ability but needs polish and to improve his feel and vision; will telegraph passes and at times commit awkward turnovers on what should be routine plays … Defensive fundamentals could use some work; his high center of gravity works against him here as well … Has struggled to sink his hips and chop his feet to keep the ball and man in front of him, which led to him being vulnerable against quick slashers and shot fakes on the perimeter … More of a PF than a wing or a big man, as he has some traits for both the perimeter and the paint but doesn’t exclusively play either role …",,"Measured: 6′ 9.25” barefoot, 8′ 10.50” standing reach 212.8 lbs, 7′ 2.00” wingspan and a 37 inch maximum vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine … Measured: 6’8.5” barefoot, 6’10.0” in shoes, 8’10.5” standing reach, 211 lbs, 7’2.0” wingspan at the 2022 NBA Draft Combine  …"," Leonard Miller is a Canadian-bred prospect who played basketball in the Ontario area & represented Canada on the FIBA U16 team before transferring to schools in Utah & Florida to make a name for himself … After struggling with injuries and receiving little playing time he transferred back to Canada and began to emerge in around the fall of 2021 as a late blooming frontcourt player who had a big growth spurt (reportedly from 6’5 to 6’10 in less than 2 years) and made even more of a name for himself in the limited action he saw in the 2022 Nike Hoop Summit … Shortly after, he declared for the 2022 NBA Draft, presumably to get feedback heading into this past season, and after a month he decided to withdraw and join the G-League Ignite program as an 18 year old…He enjoyed an overall solid season where he continued to show the rim-running athleticism, flashes of open court handling and passing, while also showing encouraging defensive potential guarding near the basket … He still is learning the nuances of the game and is a bit of a project right now, with his athleticism and physical tools being ahead of his skill level at the moment…But his production was pretty impressive given his lack of experience and overall polish (14 double doubles in 24 games during the ‘22-23 season) and offers hope that he can develop into a worthwhile frontcourt guy who can play defense against modern NBA style frontcourt guys while also being a solid offensive contributor without having plays drawn up for him … He’s still growing into himself and getting used to operating the frontcourt, but he is an upside pick that teams in the mid to late 1st round will be intrigued by considering the strides he made from last summer until now …",yes,,,,miller long 610 215 pfc nicely developing strength continue fill frame future solid runjump athlete effective move plenty success rimrunner get floor big guy great job finishing strong around hoop 60 fg inside arc also show good timing cutter operating roller screening game someone chip easy point without play directly called 18 ppg 55 fg nice hand touch close near rim strong rebounding skill particularly offensive glass must located box shot go factor getting 2nd chance point 11 rpg 32 orpg defensive glass show flash able lead break grabbing missed shot capable handling ball open court average 1st step 610 player usually quickness advantage face take bigs bounce playing c tool able successfully defend along frontcourt footwork switch perimeter budding strength defend postups length 72 wingspan make difficult matchup shoot showed flash rim protector especially weakside defender 09 bpg play strength see success keep simple offensively made 79 ft encouraging extent potential competent shooter range extends improvement last year impressive still continuing make stride prospect bit late bloomer,offensive skill level raw fundamental need refined particularly halfcourt struggle floor spacer 327 3fg 22 3fgag slow mechanical shooting form often led flat miss much wasted lower body motion inconsistent footwork getting shot spotting play high center gravity operating ball make susceptible getting pick pocketed traffic help defender even sometimes ball much shot creator set defense generally find way get point moving ball struggle decision maker ball take away thing want pressure make read react action fly doesnt really operate low block post scorer prefers face basket almost exclusively budding playmaking ability need polish improve feel vision telegraph pass time commit awkward turnover routine play defensive fundamental could use work high center gravity work well struggled sink hip chop foot keep ball man front led vulnerable quick slasher shot fake perimeter pf wing big man trait perimeter paint doesnt exclusively play either role,,0.0,2.6,0.0,TBD,TBD,TBD,TBD,TBD,-0.7881,0

Has the blow by speed to get past defenders off the dribble … Good decision maker.

Gets low, fundamental, doesn’t gamble too often. Plays the passing lanes well (1.5 spg) …An excellent athlete in a solid 6’2 point guard body, Irving has complete command and control of the basketball in terms of handle and running a team … He’s super quick, and makes it almost impossible for his defender to stay in front of him on a one on one basis … Will cause havoc with his ability to get into the lane and open things up …  He has a remarkable ability to change direction on the dime, making him virtually unguardable and deadly in the open court … Has shown the ability to finish with both hands around the basket … His outside game is above average for a guard entering his freshman year – since he has the ball in his hands most of the time, most of his shots are pull ups off the dribble, which he has shown to be an effective weapon for him, displaying sound fundamentals with his feet setup and a smooth release … has 3 point range … He has solid point guard vision, and excels in the fast break whether it’s finishing himself or throwing a timely setup pass to a teammate … His pick and roll potential could be a big weapon moving forward, as he can make the initial pass or use his impressive change of speed ability coming off a screen to get to the rim … Shows body control when going up in traffic with an ability to elude taller defenders in the air …  Defensively he plays aggressive on ball defense, showing quick footwork and the ability to stay in front of his man with a high motor and high intensity … Very composed, mature young man both on and off the floor …","Weaknesses:  Durability is a legitimate concern after he missed all but 8 games of his freshman season (heading into the post season)  …  The big question is whether this was a fluke (turftoe injury) or indicative of a bigger problem … Lack of experience at the college level  is concerning considering how difficult it is to master the position at the next level … Could struggle with the transition to the NBA game with just 8 games of NCAA experience under his belt. Granted he looked advanced for a freshmen PG … Has solid athleticism, but not elite … Not known for highlight reel dunks or a player who overwhelms opponents with his physicality … Needs to continue to work on his strength in order to improve his ability to finish and defensively … Tendency to get out of control attacking the basket … Put up tremendous numbers in his first 8 games, however it’s questionable he would have sustained that for an entire season through conference play … Appears to have the total package but missing such a huge portion of his freshman season makes him a risk. A team will have to roll the dice on limited college experience and exposure …Irving tends to get too caught up with his ability to handle the ball, at times causing over dribbling and poor offensive team possessions … Since he’s so quick and elusive off the dribble, he finds himself getting an open look on almost every possession, not necessarily a good thing from your point guard … At 6’2 his size works at the college level, but won’t give him much of an edge seeing over the defense at the professional level … His shot release point is also somewhat low… Shot selection and overall poise and control need improvement, however under Coach K that is unlikely to be an issue …",,"Turf toe injury has sidelined him for all but 11 games of his freshman season … When he returned from injury, he looked out of shape and was not as dynamic as he had been in the early part of the season … Refusing to participate in the athleticism testing (a first for a projected top pick) may raise some red flags … 10% body fat also extremely high for a guard raising the question whther he has been able to work out fully after returning from injury … His breakout performance came in a game that many felt were the two top teams in the country, at the time, with 31 points vs. Michigan State. Their collapse has made that performance less impressive in hindsight … The NBA game has gone the way of point guards and having a true PG gives a team such an edge.

203925,Joe Harris,2014,2,3,33,Draft,1610612739,Cleveland,Cavaliers,CLE,Virginia,College/University,1,Joe,Harris,,,86.0,Adam Haluska,"One the better three-point shooters in the draft, Harris finished his four-year college career second all-time in 3-point percentage (40.7%) and 3-pointers (263) at Virginia…  His forte is the catch-and-shoot – he moves tirelessly without the ball, using screens and misdirection to get open…  While he is by no means an isolation player, Harris does have a solid handle and effectively uses ball fakes, step-backs, crossovers, and hesitations to create space for his shot or go to the hole…  Not overly flashy, but is a very effective passer – anticipates well and quickly delivers to the open man.  Averaged 3.2 assists per 40 minutes as a senior at UVA…  Not an elite athlete, but is a fairly sticky defender – always has one eye on his man and the other eye on the ball, anticipates well (again), and avoids being picked off by screens by taking proper angles…  Tough and durable – broke a bone in his left hand vs. North Carolina (2/11/12) and played the rest of that game and the last eight games of that season with protection on the hand.  Also, ranks first all-time at Virginia in games played (135)…  Has great intangibles – awareness, unselfishness, fortitude, and leadership…   Weaknesses: Harris has below-average speed and struggles with faster opponents on both ends of the floor…  Disappears at times, offensively – because he relies heavily on off-the-ball movement to get open and is adverse to taking potentially contested outside shots, he can be neutralized by a sticky man-to-man defender or good team defense…  Not vertically explosive and has a short wingspan (6’6’’), and as a result, does not excel as a rebounder, a shot blocker, and a finisher…  Made a subpar 56.3 percent of his shots at the rim this past season, according to HoopMath.com…  Struggled from the free-throw line as a senior, making just 64 percent of his attempts.  It was the second straight season that his FT percentage dropped.  He made a career-high 77.2% as a sophomore…    Notes: A key member of a Virginia squad that won both the ACC regular-season championship and the ACC tournament in 2013-14…  Named ACC Tournament Most Valuable Player last season…  Had his best season as a junior, averaging a career-high 16.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game…  Made 41.7 percent (65-156) of his three-point attempts in 2010-11, the best by an ACC freshman since 2000…  At the NBA Combine, he performed as expected.  He was average to below-average in the athletic drills, but was one of the top shooters at the event, making 80 percent of his 2-point jumpers and 64 percent of his 3-pointers…   Outlook: Harris is a heady player, who shoots well, plays solid defense, and hustles.  Unfortunately, his below-average athletic ability greatly limits his potential.  His intangibles will likely pique the interest of NBA teams, and he could be a role player in the right system, such as the Spurs’ motion offense…  If he is not drafted, he should find a job in Europe, where his unselfishness and shooting/passing skills would serve him very well.Big, experienced guard with great shooting range … Shot 43% from 3 on a high volume of attempts last season…Intelligent player who led Virginia to 23 wins last season … Has a quick shot release, making him a fantastic catch-and-shoot player … Has good size for a guard, allowing him to back down smaller defenders … Makes the most of his limited athleticism in finding holes in the defense and finishing at the rim … Overall, a very efficient player who rarely takes bad shots … Has very smooth, polished shooting mechanics … Smart defender who rarely has mental lapses…Good free throw shooter who draws a fair amount of fouls … Solid rebounding guard …","Has below-average athleticism, which limits him defensively … May translate to little more than a spot-up shooting specialist in the NBA … Won’t be able to create a lot of shots against NBA defenses … Relatively poor footspeed, which will be much more exposed when he is no longer playing in Virginia’s slo-mo, grind-it-out offense … Began to struggle shooting the ball near the end of last season … Not particularly muscular for having a somewhat large frame for a guard … Nearly a full year old for his grade, further limiting his perceived upside …"," Harris is a heady player, who shoots well, plays solid defense, and hustles.  Unfortunately, his below-average athletic ability greatly limits his

start the fast break and even  make some coast to coasts… His ball handling is improving … Creates problems with his size when he tries to post up smaller defenders, forcing the defense to adjust on him… Fills the lanes beautifully while running on the fastbreak … Knows how to make the extra pass in the halfcourt, finding the open man … Has shown potential as a passer when concentrated, since he can see different angles … Has active hands on defense and can make a lot of steals because of it … His length helps him contest shooters even when he is out of balance or a step behind … He is not

shot at times and doesn’t try to mix it up … Has the tendency to force things on offense and take some shoots really early on the clock … He tries to post up smaller defenders but he doesn’t have the strength or the footwork to be a threat, since almost all the time turns on his left shoulder … There are times he plays too fast and out of control … Streaky shooter for now … Occasionaly suffers from tunnel vision while driving to the basket and doesn’t make the correct play … He can’t really create for his temmates because he is an average passer for now, having problems passing on the move or while being double-teamed … Hasn’t really been used in Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler, but when he wass the results were mixed, since he prefers to look for his shoot in these situations … Moving without the ball is an issue at times, since he has the tendency to go where the ball is, putting pressure on his team and creating spacing problems … He is just an average rebounder … He depends too much on his physical tools on defense and should work on technique and fundamentals … His lateral quickness is average and he doesn’t always have a good low stance … Has problems against explosive wings, because he can get out of balance while trying to defend them … He gets caught behind screens away from the ball and loses his opponent … At times he is standing in no man’s land on defense, looking lost … His help defense is mediorce, since he either over helps or doesn’t help at all… Stronger players can bully him in the post …",,"He started his career in VEF

Is able to make a move, keep his dribble, and then capitalize once his defender makes a mistake. Rarely allows defenders to dictate his pace. Uses a good mix of head fakes and ball handling moves to manipulate defenders. Routinely extends plays by continuing to attack defenders to force help side rotations, allowing for his teammates to find openings. Excellent at step back jumpers, especially off the pick and roll – creates a lot of space on his step backs. If defenders stay with his step back, he’s often able to drive to the rim and finish. Always has his eyes up when driving, allowing him to find cutting teammates for easy baskets when the defense helps. Mixes long strides and short choppy steps to create angles to attack. Shoots layups and runners from multiple angles and release points, making it difficult for shot blockers to anticipate his timing. Showed major improvement as a sophomore in getting to the free throw line and shooting a much improved percentage. Only scored in single digits 4 times his sophomore year","Not the explosive athlete you’d hope for at 6’4”. Lacks length with just a 6’4 wingspan …  Has a thin frame that needs to put on muscle at the next level. Passes aren’t always the most accurate – passes don’t always hit teammates in the shooting pocket. This can force teammates to take more difficult shots from time to time. Has a narrow base on his jump shots which projects better for shooting off the bounce as opposed to catch and shoot. Narrow shot base can make it easier for him to be off balance while elevating on his shot. Doesn’t get ideal elevation on his shot, which can lead to easier contests. Can try to do too much, resulting in turnovers. Over-dribbles when met with pressure. Showed a poor second effort at times defensively. Florida’s defense liked to switch 1-4 on ball screens, Mann will have to get used to fighting through/around screens more often. Allows his center of gravity to get too high while defending and can find himself getting beaten by quick guards as a result.","Mann is a skilled scorer and creator with the ball in his hands. He knows how to manipulate defenders and get to his spots on the court. However, he plays much smaller than he is, so even at 6’5”, he’s a one position player as he plays closer to 6’1”. His ability to create his own looks in the pick and roll and find ctters should translate very well to the NBA and he can make an impact right away. He likely needs to make some minor mechanical adjustments to his jumpshot, but he projects to be a solid rotation player early in his career with an opportunity to grow into a major contributor. If he can improve defensively and develop his body, he could end up being a steal in the draft.","Measured: 6’3.25” barefoot, 6’4.25”in shoes,  8’2.5” standing reach, 177.6 lbs,  6’4.0” wingspan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine …",,yes,10.1,0.011,-1.4,skilled combo guard scoring ability posse good change pace us get defender balance able make move keep dribble capitalize defender make mistake rarely allows defender dictate pace us good mix head fake ball handling move manipulate defender routinely extends play continuing attack defender force help side rotation allowing teammate find opening excellent step back jumper especially pick roll creates lot space step back defender stay step back he often able drive rim finish always eye driving allowing find cutting teammate easy basket defense help mix long stride short choppy step create angle attack shoot layup runner multiple angle release point making difficult shot blocker anticipate timing showed major improvement sophomore getting free throw line shooting much improved percentage scored single digit 4 time sophomore year,explosive athlete youd hope 64 lack length 64 wingspan thin frame need put muscle next level pass arent always accurate pass dont always hit teammate shooting pocket force teammate take difficult shot time time narrow base jump shot project better shooting bounce opposed catch shoot narrow shot base make easier balance elevating shot doesnt get ideal elevation shot lead easier contest try much resulting turnover overdribbles met pressure showed poor second effort time defensively florida defense liked switch 14 ball screen mann get used fighting througharound screen often allows center gravity get high defending find getting beaten quick guard result,mann skilled scorer creator ball hand know manipulate defender get spot court however play much smaller even 65 he one position player play closer 61 ability create look pick roll find ctters translate well nba make impact right away likely need make minor mechanical adjustment jumpshot project solid rotation player early career opportunity grow major contributor improve defensively develop body could end steal draft,32.66614173,1.85,60.43236221,-0.181645456,TBD,TBD,TBD,Y,-0.6679,0

quickness … Has shown that he can be disrupted offensively when guarded by taller more athletic players … Defensively his lack of explosiveness and wingspan doesn’t allow him to be much of a shot blocker … Although he is an adequate post defender his average lateral quickness will hurt his perimeter offense … Still needs to develop his post footwork as he picks up travel violations from time to time … Although he has shown a good array of moves with his back to the basket, he’ll need to polish them to have the ame success againt the NBA elite … He could stand to become more comfortable facing the basket … The fact that he is a year older than most in his class has led some to suggest that he is close to his peak in development.At 6-8, he’s undersized for the power forward position

is often off-balance and his shooting form becomes inconsistent resulting in many badly missed shots His midrange game may be key for his success at the next level, because even with his athleticism, he struggled to finish in traffic during his season ending slump This can probably be attributed to the lack of height, because at 64 he is very undersized for the SG position Being able to pull up

ahead … Creative when driving to the basket, utilizing his big hands to palm the ball … Has put a few unsuspecting defenders on posters … Straight line speed is above average and helps him flourish in

him one of the older prospects being considered for this year’s draft … A bit undersized for a SG at 6′ 4"" with a 6′ 7"" wingspan and a 8′ 1"" standing reach, so he has prototype size for a SG that

often proved to be an undisciplined and erratic player … his tripping incidents were a little blown out of proportion by media, however he didn’t make himself any fans with his behavior … Is the type of player that doesn’t seem to always have a short memory, and will compound a bad shooting performance by letting it effect the rest of his game … Sometimes his decision making is questionable … Will take unnecessary risks when looking to create, and has a habit of jumping in the air with nowhere to go as a passer and when finishing at the rim, leading to bad possessions … Does not handle length and athleticism that well, can be smothered when hedged by athletic bigs and struggle to contain dribble penetration when matched up with quicker, more athletic players … Ordinary handles, does not show much creativity with the ball and will not strike fear in the hearts of NBA teams in an isolation set … Has some rigidness to him, tends to play too upright when handling the ball which limits his quickness attacking defenders…Only shot 45% or above from the floor in 1 season in his career (2015-2016), which is concerning …Well-documented history of dirty plays and meltdowns during games, which very likely has been dissected by NBA teams that have interviewed him … His effort is to be commended, but the fact that Duke had to switch to a zone defense to mask the team’s defensive lapses is alarming … Has experience playing as a lead guard, but it is tough to see that translating to the next level considering some of the holes in his game …Was not as effective a player with teammate and projected lottery pick Marvin Bagley in the lineup this past season …Lacks ideal size and athleticism for a shooting guard. While he gets a lot of dunks on drives, he doesn’t possess the first step to get past elite defenders nor the athleticism to stand out at the position in the NBA … Need to work on his in-between game … At this point he generally does all of his damage shooting the three or taking the ball right to the basket … Avoids contact when attacking the hoop … Tries too often to jump around defenders instead of through the impending contact … Despite an up tick in play is averaging less than one additional free throw attempt per 40 minutes this year (6.6 free throw attempts as a freshman and 7.2 FTA this year) … Needs to become more comfortable with the ball in his hands … If you take away his first two options he often struggles to improvise … Not much of a creator with the ball … Doesn’t have the handle to make plays for others … Lacks a certain feel for the game in terms of making those around him better … At just 6’5"", and with a small wingspan, he’s on the shorter side for a two guard … Hasn’t shown the ability to be a consistent defender … Can be caught fighting for rebounds unsuccessfully instead of rotating back for transition defense … Not very agile, lacking lateral

Extremely loose handle with no creation skill … Has very little wiggle to his game – isn’t going to go around anybody with the ball in his hand. Lacks offensive versatility, practically all of his offense came right at the rim or from three – nothing in between … Shot only 30.5% from three in college on 1.7 attempts per game. Most of his offense was the result of a teammate setting him up or from him getting an offensive rebound and putback. His slow, two footed gathers when attacking the rim will allow NBA level players enough time to recover and contest his looks at the rim. Has essentially two moves when driving to the rim, a weak euro step without mush side to side movement and trying to drive right through defenders which could lead to offensive fouls.

Uses his length well defensively …","Despite his great length and athleticism, lacks great foot speed to blow by opponents allowing them to crowd him on the perimeter … Can be a bit slow to react on defense, opening himself up to back cuts … Gets stuck on screens defensively … Was primarily a shooter/scorer for Duke – didn’t produce a lot in other categories. Also benefited being a complementary scorer, not having the same responsibility to carry his team like other top prospects, leaving some questions of how well he can perform in that role … Had some lackluster performances, in particular in Duke’s loss to UNC in the Final Four … Role with Duke expanded as season went along, but seemed to struggle some with how aggressive to be as a shooter … Doesn’t get quite as much lift on his jumper as you might want for the next level … Would like to see him speed up his release just a little to compensate for his lack of lift on jumper … Sometimes picks up his dribble without knowing where he’s going with the ball … Can rock with the ball while dribbling to get a rhythm, which can make him more predictable for high level defenders … Sometimes goes into a triple threat on the catch, allowing the defense to catch up, when he should just get the ball and go with it … Also seems to go side to side instead of trying to blow by defenders in ISO … Stronger attacking when going with his right hand, can look to pull back or go into a hesitation move more when the ball is in his left – A “tell”, allowing defenders to better predict what he’s looking to do … There are concerns about what he’ll give you on nights where he isn’t scoring …","Griffin is a player that can step in and play a role right now on an NBA team … For that reason, he has an extremely high floor for his NBA career … Some of his biggest weaknesses revolve around needing to refine his mechanics so it’s easier for him to get his shot off and making himself less predictable – things that can be learned. Even if he fails to address those issues, he can play the role of a spot up shooter with the hope of becoming a 3-and-D guy as he becomes more comfortable on the defensive end, which should come in time. However, if he is able to adjust his game so that he is better able to attack NBA level defenders and keep them off balance, he has legitimate All-Star potential. He’s essentially a shooter that has the athleticism to not only finish at the rim, but has the strength to finish through contact and the leaping ability to be able to dunk the ball on defenders which takes shot blockers out of the equation to some extent. Despite his fantastic skill level, he is a bit unrefined in areas, which makes me believe there is some room for growth in his game, and he could make a big jump during his second or third NBA season.

Preston’s patient feel for the game, basketball IQ and crafty passing skills easily stand out when watching him play…Given his size at the lead guard spot, he has excellent court vision and the ability to whizz passes to open teammates from all over the court…Extremely productive operating in pick and roll offense, showing great timing with his passes while also being a threat to knock down shots when defenders go underneath screens (39% 3FG as a Jr.)…Also used pick and roll offense to have success calling his own number, getting to the paint and converting or in the mid range where he shows a promising floater…Uses his long-striding speed, the threat to make a quick pass and a nice command of hesitation dribbles to turn the corner well…Adept at manipulating defenders to create passing windows, often tilting or freezing the defense off the dribble and then making accurate dump-offs for high percentage plays…Keeps his head up and makes good decisions to create easy baskets against hard hedges, where his size and timing as a passer really shows most…Nice shooting touch and has range to the NBA 3-point line off the dribble and with his feet set, confidence grew with each year he spent in college…Uses his body to shield smaller guards in the lane well, keeps defenders on his hip to create lanes to score or collapse the defense and find the open man…Would be fun to

dominant, can be less effective when forced to drive and finish with his off hand…Not afraid to make defenders pay when they play off of him, but is a bit inconsistent shooting off the dribble…Has a limited sample size against top competition, didnt always face the kind of athletes he will see on the pro level on a game-to-game basis…Some of the bad habits he has developed fundamentally playing

1628374,Lauri Markkanen,2017,1,7,7,Draft,1610612750,Minnesota,Timberwolves,MIN,Arizona,College/University,1,Lauri,Markkanen,,,92.0,Nikola Mirotic/Ryan Anderson,"Markkanen was one of the top freshmen in college basketball last season, despite a middle of the year shooting slump, scoring 15.6 points per game on 42% shooting from beyond the arc … Markkanen’s combination of size and skill makes him one of the more intriguing prospects in the draft, and he will have the chance to develop into a valued stretch-four man in the Association … He is mature young man and appeared to be an exceptionally focused and likable teammate in his one year at Arizona … Markkanen’s upside starts with his outstanding size for an NBA power forward at 7-0 and 230 pounds … He is a fluid athlete with great coordination for his size … Most of the intrigue with him, however, is his unique offensive skillset … Markkanen is a high-IQ player that knows how to play the game very efficiently … As mentioned above, Markkanen shot 42% from distance on 5.9 attempts per 40 minutes, and he may actually be the best shooter in this draft regardless of position … He has smooth mechanics, a soft touch, and good balance off the catch … He is not only lethal off the catch, but he is also a prolific shooter on the move off of screens, pull-ups, face-up jumpers out of the post, etc … He particularly showed these abilities off earlier in the year when teammate Allonzo Trier was out for the earlier part of the season, causing him to play a lot of small forward and rely on more perimeter scoring … With more spacing at the NBA level, he will be a tremendous pick and pop threat and be able to maximize his shooting ability … Markkanen moves well without the ball when looking to spot up from the perimeter, and he knows how to find the open spot on the arc to get off a good look … His mechanics also stay consistent even when his shot is contested … He always gets his feet under him and does not waste any motion from catch to release … He runs off of screens like a guard, as he gets his feet set quickly and appears to be very comfortable rising into his shot here … In addition, he has great footwork when chased off the three-point line and can effortlessly shoot the ball off the dribble, especially going to his left … He even showed flashes of pull-up jumpers as a pick and roll ball handler in his arsenal, something extremely rare for his size … His agility for his 7-0, 238 pound frame jumps out, as he is decently effective off the bounce, which will be key for him going forward when defenders chase him off the arc … He has a pretty quick first step that is definitely good enough to get by many of the players that will be guarding him in the NBA … He is very good going to his left with the ability to put it on the floor and finish going left just as comfortably as he does with his right … Markkanen is not a high level athlete, but he can finish above the rim in space due to his superior height and decent leaping ability for his size … He also does a solid job of attacking the offensive glass for a stretch-four man … He does a great job of stepping out and hedging ball screens as well, a situation he will probably be in quite often in today’s pick and roll heavy NBA. Markkanen’s role in the NBA will be clearly defined as a stretch-four man, who can thrive in the role of instant offense off the bench or something along the lines of what Ryan Anderson brings to Houston …  Weaknesses: As skilled as Markkanen is on the offensive end, he offers nowhere near the same potential on defense … His lack of strength is a major soncern as he gets toseed around pretty easily by NCAA bigs and already has filled out with broad shoulders … His core and leg strength need a lot of work, and may never allow him to battle inside against the NBA’s top post players … He does not have great length, limiting his ability to protect the rim, and being thin for his height, he plays a lot smaller than his size … He may be more of a mismatch as a stretch-five man on offense, but the flip side is that he may not have any chance to slow down most centers on the defensive end … As mentioned, Markkanen’s lack of a strong base hinders his ability to battle for position in the post … He is also not very physical down low, and he does not have the length to contest shots from other post players to make up for his inability to fight for good position … Combine his lack of length with just average timing and instincts, and he could be a potential liability on this end of the court … On the perimeter he has good feet, but he has a tendency to bend his back instead of his knees to get down in his stance, which eliminates some lateral quickness and effectiveness … He is a nightmare to guard as a stretch-four on offense, but he often gets lost when trying to defend opposing stretch-fours on the perimeter … His intincts in defending the pick and roll and knowing when to come help from the weak side also needs to improve … His rebounding ability is also less than stellar for many of the same reasons that his defensive upside is limited … Markkanen averaged an underwhelming 9.3 rebounds per 40 minutes, as he lacks the length, range, and toughness to be a force in this department … He does not always work hard to get great position when the shot goes up, nor does he have the necessary frame to push opposing big men out of position … Scouts also question how much more there really is to his offensive game than just his shooting ability … He does not appear to have much of a post game, other than simple jump hooks and turnaround jumpers and is not a great finisher in traffic … Not the most vocal or demonstrative person, will need to work on being more assertive and vocal on the floor … He also is not a very gifted playmaker at this stage (1.2 assists per 40 minutes) and he goes left most times he puts the ball on the floor … He is much better attacking off the dribble from the catch than in isolation situations, and he does not look nearly as natural shooting the ball when going to his right hand … Aside from the defensive concerns, he also must develop his offensive repertoire outside of his jump shot.Versatile player who can play as a power forward and center… He has impressive mobility and coordination for a player his size… Possesses a nice physique and has added considerable muscle the last couple of years with no effect on his mobility … He runs the floor well and is actually really good in the open floor… Good inside-outside player who can mix it up on offense, although at the moment his face up game is a lot better than his back to the basket game… He can score in bunches and can “catch fire” at any time… He doesn’t force things on offense and lets the game come to him… He is already considered a great shooter from the perimeter, thanks to his great mechanics and NBA 3-point range… Very good in catch and shoot situations, especially from 45-degree angle… Plays Excellent the Pick and Pop as a screener, thanks to his great touch around the basket… Has improved on Pick and Roll Situations as the screener and has learned to cut faster to the basket after setting a screen… Has the ability to attack closeouts thanks to his explosive first step… Likes to finish strong at the basket and isn’t afraid of contact… Can put the ball on the floor and can even start the break or complete a coast to coast if the right opportunity comes up… He has even been used in Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler at times, with mixed results…  He gets at the free throw line at a high rate and he is a very good free throw shooter… Above average rebounder who rarely forgets to box out… Has good instincts on Defense, reads plays and as a result he makes a lot of steals… He has solid lateral quickness … Can defend the Pick and Roll at an acceptable rate when he is asked to hedge out… Knows the law of verticality and has good enough timing to make some blocks…","His wingspan is average and that limits him on both ends of the floor… He is a good but not an elite athlete… He needs time to gather before jumping and that could hurt him at the next level… He could add a little more weight to be able to stand the physicality of the next level… His back to the basket game isn’t completely there yet… He doesn’t always establish position in the post and has problems doing it against physical players… He could improve his ball handling to be more effective on Isolation situations… His shooting mechanics are excellent, but his shooting release is a little slow, which gives his opponents time to contest his shot… Consistency is an issue, since he still has the tendency to disappear for long stretches of games … At times he is a little passive on offense and doesn’t always ask for the ball… Just an average passer for now… Off ball Defense needs work, since at times he is too focused on the ball and loses sight of the player he is guarding… He must improve on Post Defense, learn how to use his body and not get bullied by physical players… Weak side defense is also an issue since at times he is just a step too slow to help… It’s really difficult to imagine him becoming an elite shot blocker due to his average wingspan and inability to jump high from a standing position … He has problems defending when he is asked to switch and has to guard an explosive perimeter player since his lateral quickness is just OK for now…",,"Rated as a five-star prospect by numerous scouting services, including ESPN, Scout and 24/7 Sports… The highest-rated European prospect of the 2016 class on ESPN to commit to a college program… Represented his home country of Finland in FIBA U16, U18 and U20 European Championships… Was the leading scorer at the 2016 U20 Euros, averaging 24.9 points, 8.6 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 2.3 steals and 1.3 blocks per game… Third Team All-American for Arizona… First Team All-Pac-12 Selection… Member of the Pac-12 All-Freshmen Team… Finalist for John R. Wooden Award and the Karl Malone Award… Pac-12 All-Tournament Team member… Two-time Pac-12 Player of the Week"," Markkanen is a player to keep an eye on. At first glance he looks like a prototypical Stretch-4, but he can become a lot more than just that. His ability to score from just about everywhere on the floor is what makes him special, but he has all the necessary tools to become a two-way player. With that said, he still has long ways to go in many aspects of the game, especially on Defense, but if he continues working hard he can become a very good player in the future. Likely will need some adjustment time to playing against American athletes …  ",yes,16.8,0.112,7.3,markkanen one top freshman college basketball last season despite middle year shooting slump scoring

Rebounds well for a guard (4.5 per game, season high 13 against Tennessee) … Sneaky athlete, with better leaping ability than some realize …Tyler Herro is a versatile guard and an elite shooter … While 35.5% from 3 is not an elite number, it should rise with time and repetition … What is more telling is his 93.5% free throw percentage this past season … He has deep range and a quick release with the ability to get his own shot. He also has an advanced mid-range game and can play on or off the ball, showing legit point guard skills. Has good instincts and high basketball IQ. Has excellent length with a 6-10 wingspan. A versatile defender who can guard 3 positions and plays with an edge. Herro is a solid rebounder and has good size at 6-6 that will allow him to contribute on the glass as a guard. Herro is a terrific shot maker, but he also is a solid scorer anywhere on the court off the catch and shoot or off the dribble. His scoring off the dribble improved throughout the season. Herro’s playmaking is also underrated, as he posted close to a 2:1 assist to turnover ratio. Herro’s also has plenty of upside as a defender with his size, length and above-average athleticism. He has solid anticipation, averaging a steal per game in his freshman season. He is a solid distributing guard that has the potential to become an above average 3&D player in the NBA.","Lacks length. Doesn’t have the ideal NBA body, measuring  6’5” with 6’4.5” wingspan and had 12.4% body fat at UK’s pro day … Struggles with his footwork when receiving the ball off of screens, often does not have them squared up and thus preventing him from getting quickly into a shooting motion … Absolutely not a ball handler … Can be a streaky shooter that goes cold for stretches of the game … Not very explosive off the dribble lacking a great first step … Lacks ideal lateral quickness, leading to him struggling with smaller, quicker players when playing defense … When not scoring, he can have games in which he gives you little else … Not a great passer, and he can get tunnel vision when driving to the rim … Sometimes struggles making entry passes to the post, resulting in turnovers … Has a loose handle and is susceptible to getting stripped when driving to the rim … Limited athleticism could be a hindrance at the next level, and will have to rely more on angles to set himself up at the NBA level …Herro can make shots in a multitude of ways, but he can be very inconsistent with his shot. He has a tendency to force the issue and not distribute the ball at times. He has the potential to become an elite 3-point shooter and above average defender in this league, but he must be willing to adapt when his shot is not falling. He also must improve his pace as he can at times play too fast and be out of control. He does not have elite athleticism, so when Herro does guard elite athletic two guards it becomes a challenge. Could struggle to guard against NBA quickness. Doesn’t project as a player who can get to the rim with constancy at the NBA level and will have a hard time getting separation. Lacks lower body strength. Doesn’t get off the floor very well and isn’t an above the rim player.","Projects to be a serviceable bench player to spot starter early in his career with the ability to develop into a reliable scorer at the next level … May never be good enough defensively to fill the 3 and D role, but rapid development in college suggests the ability to carve out an important role on a good team … Is often viewed as just a shooter, but can score in a variety of ways and should be able to translate that portion of his game to the NBA … Could play a Richard Hamilton type role offensively for a number of teams, albeit with a significantly smaller usage rate … The added spacing of an NBA offense should open up his offense beyond what he was able to show at Kentucky … Lack of versatility could limit him as he isn’t a ball handler, but his offensive ability could really impress teams in pre-draft workouts …","Measured 6’5"" in shoes, 6’4"" barefoot, 193 lbs, 6’3.75"" wingspan, 8’3.5"" standing reach at 2017 USA Basketball October Minicamp …Measured 6’5"" in shoes, 6’4"" barefoot, 193 lbs, 6’3.75"" wingspan, 8’3.5"" standing reach at 2017 USA Basketball October Minicamp … Born Jan. 20, 2000 in Milwaukee…Tabbed the top-ranked recruit from the state of Wisconsin and was rated No. 30 overall by ESPN … Suited up for the Jordan Brand Classic game and participated in the Nike Hoop Summit … Also was one of 54 players selected for the USA Basketball Junior National Team minicamp his senior season….

wings…Has a nice jumper but he was too streaky as a Fr to be considered a true marksman … Has the groundwork of a well-rounded scoring threat, but until his shot creating and jumper get more consistent he could be categorized as a “Jack of all trades, master of none” type … Prefers to step back and side step to create space for shots as opposed to getting north and south as a ball-handler, which can limit the pressure he puts on the heart of the defense while also limiting how often he gets to the foul line (75% FT shooter) … While he isn’t opposed to making the extra pass to an open teammate and the glimpses he showed in combine scrimmages and workouts are encouraging, it certainly wouldn’t hurt to keep making strides to prove he has the instincts and passing skills to

203944,Julius Randle,2014,1,7,7,Draft,1610612747,Los Angeles,Lakers,LAL,Kentucky,College/University,1,Julius,Randle,,,96.0,David Lee/Billy Owens,"Very strong upper body and a reliable left hand … He shows a strong motor, and finishes well around the rim with contact … He is very skilled with his face up game and has shown some creative finishing ability … He is very dangerous on P&R and Pick and Pop, because of his ability to hit mid-range jumpers … Though he lacks elite explosiveness, he is able to use his strong frame to protect the ball and avoid blocks … On the offensive boards he is an absolute beast, relentless in seeking out rebounds … The same thing is true on the defensive end where he has natural instincts for rebounds … A pretty good post defender, he uses his strong body to not allow taller opponents to get close to the rim … He doesn’t have the quickest feet in the world, but definitely really good for a big, very balanced … Potentially he can switch on P&R situations for a couple of dribbles, but needs to improve on his showing … Randle is a mix of power, skills and balance that makes him a very interesting prospect … Despite being just a freshman he could have an immediate impact in the NBA due to his strength and offensive skills … He has drawn positive reviews for his attitude and coach-ability and appears to be a hard working kid that leaves everything on the floor every game and every practice …Strong body … Has a high skill level for a high school sophomore … Excels at facing up and putting the ball on the floor … Very good finisher around the basket … Can step out and hit shots all the way to college 3pt. range … Can play with his back to the basket but prefers face up game … A good kid with a great work ethic …","Despite all the good things mentioned about his game there are a lot of concerns about Randle … In a way Randle’s high energy, ""bully ball"" style of playing reminds some of how Shabazz, at a different position, overpowered people last year and we’ve seen how much the former UCLA small forward has struggled in the league … It’s been noted that Randle is undersized for the PF position, lacking ideal length with a sub 7 foot wingspan … He may struggle to create looks against stronger, more athletic and taller opponents in the post … Offensively his numbers on synergy indicate how difficult it has been for him to score on post moves with very low percentages on each low post block and over either shoulder … It also doesn’t help matters that he is not able to utilize his right hand … Very few, even highly talented, players are able to play at high level without being able to finish and make moves with both hands, as the book becomes well known and everyone overplays their strength. I’m not sure if Randle fits this category, but the fear is there … His shooting isn’t consistent and despite good mechanics, his percentages are low and 3pts range is non-existent … He will have to develop a consistent solid jumpshot to replicate the success of Zach Randolph and Michael Beasley when facing the basket … Overall his game right now is based almost entirely on overpowering weaker opponents … He is very skilled but it will be hard to find the same success overpowering post players in the league. Also it is worth considering that most of Randle’s game is below the rim … His future will likely hinge more heavily than most prospects on landing in the right system, where a team has a vision of how to utilize him and makes sure he stays focused and works hard on the right skill development … A bad team or loss or focus could pose a huge risk to his NBA career …While very solid, especially considering his age, not a jaw dropping physical specimen type of athlete … Doesn’t play on the box as much as he should, too perimeter oriented. Should focus a little more on refining his post game which will really be his bread and butter as he gets older … Settles for too many jumpers at times instead of imposing his will inside … Too left hand dominant. Needs to work at using his right hand better …",,"One of the most polarizing prospects of this year’s draft … He started the year regarded as one of the top forwards in the country. Talented and tough he was the star player of the highly valued freshman class of Kentucky … He has been very solid averaging 15 points and over 10 rebounds per game, but the poor performance of the Wildcats until the NCAA tournament seemed to have diminished the Randle brand … His upside is in fact the same one he had one year ago, very limited. However he is definitely a player ready to produce … You always know what you are going to get from him, and March Madness has proved he can help his team succeed …Considered by many to be the top player in the 2013 class … Measured 6’9 (in shoes) 243 lbs, with a 6’10 wingspan at the 2011 LeBron James Skills Academy … Measured 6’10 (in shoes) 240 lbs, with a 6’11 wingspan at the 2012 LeBron James Skills Academy … Measured 6’9 (in shoes) 248 lbs, with a 6’11 wingspan and 8’9.5 reach at the 2013 Nike Hoop Summit",,yes,18.1,0.1,13.6,strong upper body reliable left hand show strong motor finish well around rim contact skilled face game shown creative finishing ability dangerous pr pick pop ability hit midrange jumper though lack elite explosiveness able use strong frame protect ball avoid block offensive board absolute beast relentless seeking rebound thing true defensive end natural instinct rebound pretty good post defender us strong body allow taller opponent get close rim doesnt quickest foot world definitely really good big balanced potentially switch pr situation couple dribble need improve showing randle mix power skill balance make interesting prospect despite freshman could immediate impact nba due strength offensive skill drawn positive review attitude coachability appears hard working kid leaf everything floor every game every practice strong body high skill level high school sophomore excels facing putting ball floor good finisher around basket step hit shot way college 3pt range play back basket prefers face game good kid great work ethic,despite good thing mentioned game lot concern randle way randles high energy bully ball style playing reminds shabazz different position overpowered people last year weve seen much former ucla small forward struggled league noted randle undersized pf position lacking ideal length sub 7 foot wingspan may struggle create look stronger athletic taller opponent post offensively number synergy indicate difficult score post move low percentage low post block either shoulder also doesnt help matter able utilize right hand even highly talented player able play high level without able finish make move hand book becomes well known everyone overplays strength im sure randle fit category fear shooting isnt consistent despite good mechanic percentage low 3pts range nonexistent develop consistent solid jumpshot replicate success zach randolph michael beasley facing basket overall game right based almost entirely overpowering weaker opponent skilled hard find success overpowering post player league also worth considering randles game rim future likely hinge heavily prospect landing right system team vision utilize make sure stay focused work hard right skill development bad team loss focus could pose huge risk nba career solid especially considering age jaw dropping physical specimen type athlete doesnt play box much perimeter oriented focus little refining post game really bread butter get older settle many jumper time instead imposing inside left hand dominant need work using right hand better,,67.50352941,1.3,87.75458824,1.108214795,N,N,N,N,0.9668,1
203490,Otto Porter Jr,2013,1,3,3,Draft,1610612764,Washington,Wizards,WAS,Georgetown,College/University,1,Otto,Porter,Jr,,94.0,Tayshaun Prince,"Porter is a multi-skilled small forward possessing tremendous length (7’1 wingspan) and veteran basketball savvy at 19-years of age. He’s in constant motion away from the ball, roaming the baseline, cutting backdoor or settling into soft spots. Utilizes that same motor to get out in the open court and runs exceedingly well end to end; averages 1.45 PPP in transition. Plays to his strengths and works hard to ameliorate areas of weakness. He upped his scoring output from 9.7 as a freshman to 16.2 as a sophomore (48% FG). The key ingredient to his offensive explosion was improved long-range proficiency, from 23% to 42% (12 makes to 43). 51% adjusted FG% in spot up opportunities. Highly efficient in the mid-range from either elbow — catch and shoot coming off screens (or working the middle of 2-3) and dribbling into jumpers with one or two habit bounces. His unorthodox style and arm length frequently result in contact; makes excellent use of the pump fake. He gets to the free throw stripe 5 times per game and converts at 77%. Prudent decision maker with ball in hand when asked to facilitate in the Princeton system- 2.7:1.5 assist: turnover ratio. In sync with teammates and uses the dribble to create better passing angles. His feel for the game and nose for the ball are highlighted on the boards. His length/motor/instincts (reading caroms) allow him to chase down misses outside of his area (7.5 REB). Contests every jump shot– even when a shooter creates space, his wingspan negates a clear look (0.9 BLK). Hedges screens aggressively and disrupts hand-offs (1.8 STL). Porter was a late bloomer that did not play on the AAU circuit. Finished classes after declaring for the draft and gets the” big picture”. Stable performer, never see him flustered. Porter is a rising Soph. wing prospect with a lot of raw potential after emerging into an important player for Georgetown despite being a lightly touted late bloomer out of HS … Pretty unique type of player with an unorthodox style … Possesses great size and length on the wing at 6’8 with a lot of length, (7’1 wingspan) and a 205 lb frame that can definitely add plenty of muscle … Very smooth athleticism and nice balance for a guy his height … Plays a smart, composed game as you’d expect from a JT3-coached player … Understands his role on both ends, and rarely plays outside of his own comfort zone … Moves very well off the ball, and presents himself with about 2 or 3 very high percentage shots every game … Not going to make many mistakes finishing around the rim, where his solid athleticism and imposing length are all beneficial to him … Effective with unorthodox short range jumpers from just outside of the paint … Heady passer, who will reward cutters when there is a passing lane to do so … Doesn’t need to hold the ball for a lot of time to make an impact when on the court … Unselfish … Good rebounder on both ends of the floor partially due to his length, and is also willing to dive on the floor and get physical on the glass…Has the ability to get chase down blocks when beaten off the dribble, and is never completely out of plays defensively when defending 1-on-1 … Enough length to effectively defend SF’s of any size in the long term … Will continue to get better as he adds strength and polish … Was productive for a guy who wasn’t heavily relied upon last season … Will probably benefit a lot by the experience he gained this past year …","Smooth run/jump athlete but missing the trademark explosion of a lottery talent. The power quotient is noticeably absent as well. While muscle definition is more noticeable, he has not added substantial bulk in his two years (from 200 to 205). It appears he has the broad shoulders to support more weight. He lacks the tools to impose his will on the game. Has difficulty creating clean looks for himself- off the dribble creativity is elementary and he’s more slippery/slithery than quick. Aptitude shooting off the bounce is often condensed to 1 or 2 dribbles, doesn’t rise up and elevate off hard drives. Not a consistent breakdown candidate, dependent on another playmaker or garbage buckets in the half court. Limited albeit diverse role player. Porter was utilized as a “pick and pop” threat just three times all season, failing to showcase potentially his greatest attribute as an undersized 4. His jump shot mechanics are awkward with elbows out and funky sidespin rotation. To his credit, he’s made it work a la Shawn Marion. Top-notch defender in all situations that don’t require side to side movement in open space. There are clear shortcomings in the lateral quickness department, which he masks with makeup speed and length.Right now, Porter is a very raw prospect with a lot of work to do to reach his untapped potential … Poor jump shooter right now, shot just above 20% on 3’s as a Fr. and even though he fared better from short and mid-range with his shot he still needs to basically learn how to shoot…Rarely shoots the same shot and thus has very sporadic results with his jumper … On top of his lack of jump shooting skills, its most concerning that he isn’t a good shot creator at all … Struggles to get shots for himself and really is a poor ball-handler on the perimeter … Plays with a high center of gravity, and it effects his ability to swiftly move laterally and make/contain sudden movements … Can get beat off the bounce by quicker wings … Right now plays a combo forward game, so improving as a ball handler and shooter is imparitive … Although he is unselfish, he can be passive and has a tendency to float offensively … Lacks strength and girth at 6’9 205, and will need to add strength to better adjust to physical play, maximize his athleticism, and even improve his jump shot consistency … Has a lot to learn and to improve upon, but is very young and still has a whole lot of time to develop …",,"Notes: Measured 6’8 (in shoes) 200 lbs, with a 7’1 wingspan at the 2012 Kevin Durant Skills Academy"," Porter is a prospect with very good upside and physical tools … He’s a tall wing and his length makes him a high upside player, along with his late bloomer status … He really plays within himself and seems to be a smart player with plenty of time to improve … His shot, handle and strength all need major improvement but Porter has a lot of long term appeal as a prospect …",yes,15.6,0.132,12.6,porter multiskilled small forward possessing tremendous length 71 wingspan veteran basketball savvy 19years age he constant motion away ball roaming baseline cutting

Shot 57% from the perimeter in the month of March on over four attempts per game … Accurate and crafty passer who is deadly passing to cutting wings and big men in the paint … The Volunteers used a lot of two-big lineups and Chandler frequently found space for one of them to finish at the rim … High level finisher around big men when he is driving to the rim … Capable of leaping above the rim to block shots from behind and contest big men at the rim from help positions … Good anticipation defensively as he averaged over two steals per game on the season, with most coming from jumping passing lanes and scoring in transition … Disruptive defender on and off the ball who can speed up opponents and generate turnovers … Runs the offense with poise and pace and can adjust based on the flow of the game … His speed and shooting give him nice potential and he should benefit from an extremely weak PG class in 2022 … Still only 19 years-old and a solid end to the season could put him in the lottery discussion especially for teams willing to be patient with his transition to the professional game6’0 point guard … Good length with a 6’5 wingspan … Solid build … Quick with the ball and makes moves in the open floor without losing speed … Very good shooter with proper mechanics, arc, and ball rotation.

Played predominantly the 4 spot for Marquette, occasionally forced to play the 5.

Possesses tremendous range well beyond the NBA 3, which he put on display at the Reese’s All-Star Game at the Final Four (5 threes). Shot 35% from distance as a senior in 5.5 attempts per game … Found some of his best looks in the pick and pop game, where he was very effective stepping out … Hit 17 of 25 college threes and 15 of 25 NBA threes at the combine shooting drill. Utilizes the pump fake well knowing opponents must respect his jumper … When he sees an open lane, he attacks the hole with reckless abandon- wills his way to the basket … Outstanding FT shooter, shooting 82% as a junior and 84% as a senior. Won 96 games in his 4 years at Marquette … Clutch player, not afraid to take and make big shots. Made drastic improvements in all facets of the game during his collegiate career … Increased his scoring average from 6.8 as a freshman to 18.1 as a senior, and rebounding from 3.6 to 7.5 (8.6 rpg as a junior).

While he’s an efficient spot up shooter, does not shoot well on the move or off the dribble. Needs time to get his legs underneath the shot. Additional cultivation of the mid-range game will be critical to his success. Did not spend time coming off screens in college, usually acting as the screener … Can he use screens effectively and make shots? His ball handling skills are extremely limited for an NBA SG/SF … Has minimal creativity as a result, and unable to get shots for himself … Dribbles with his head fixated on the ground … Had turnover problems (2 per game) despite limited ballhandling responsibilities … Was the beneficiary of open 3 pt looks floating around the three point stripe when defended by bigs … Open spaces will be few and far between when guarded by players of comparable size … Became heavily reliant on the three rather than using his brute strength inside.

He gets nearly all of his points playing as a 4, and there are major questions about his ability to create offense for himself facing the basket. Granted, he’s by far the tallest player on his high school team, so playing anything other than center is irrational from a team standpoint … Plays too upright defensively. Looks a little stiff in his movements. While his physical strength is good, he appears to lack some flexibility in his body. Ankles and hips lack fluidity as he appears to run and move more like a 4 than a 3 … Has been called ""California soft"" by some observers, but to his credit doesn’t shy away from contact.

He has the offensive ability to take over games and calls for the ball on the court when hes feeling it. He has the ability to handle the ball, and take it to the basket aggressively and with a quick first and second step. He draws fouls well. He can pass and plays tough defense when he wants to. He can defend the power forward position, can block shots and is an excellent rebounder with the ability to dominate the glass. Donte plays very relaxed, and loves to make big loud plays on both offense and defense. He shows an interest in being a vocal leader on the court.

Brings his best effort every game.","Despite garnering a ton of hype throughout his HS career, there is a sense that he has been intentionally hidden from NBA draft evaluators … While the combine exhibited his high level run/jump ability, he really struggles to explode when he meets contact … His legs and core have always been a concern, as he measured at 216 lbs at the NBA Draft Combine after measuring at 218 lbs during the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit, and without noticeable change as far as adding muscle to his upper body … There is a sense that what you see is what you get in terms of his body and any additional weight could slow him down or put pressure on his legs that they may not be able to handle … He gets knocked off balance easily, and has had a lot of trouble establishing himself in the post against stronger defenders … Has played on the perimeter so much that getting used to playing his more natural PF position will likely be a major adjustment, especially physically … Has definite lapses as far as defensive awareness … Lateral quickness is not to the point that he can defend NBA wing players, squashing any notion that he can be a 3 … Reaction time to plays on both ends can be slow at times, will bobble passes and let his man get behind him more often than you would like … While he is known for his handle, when he pushes the ball in the open floor it often leads to turnovers, and that asset probably won’t translate to the NBA … While in the post, has a bad habit of bringing the ball down low, leading to strips and effecting his shot, and also not lead to not drawing as many fouls as he drew at the HS level … While he has played against a national schedule for years and done well in some marquee match-ups, it’s incredibly difficult to evaluate a player who did not play in college or Europe, as we saw a large range of for high school players back when it was commonplace due to the huge amount of risk … Had a tough time at the Hoop Summit when matched-up with Skal Labissiere, whose struggles this season may cause people to wonder just how much further Maker has to go as well … Post defense will likely be a big issue, could be someone who has to deal with foul issues early on … Does not have the quickest release, plus will need to work on his overall consistency as an outside shooter … Shot selection will have to change quite a bit, will be interesting to see how he adapts … Lacks much of a low post repertoire, and the physical play in the paint will probably be a giant hurdle for him  …While he has added some upper body strength, he still needs to get stronger, especially in the lower body. With his slight frame, there are concerns about how he will physically develop long term. His lack of lower body strength prevents him from getting low post position, even against shorter defenders. He gets knocked off balance. Has a tendency to duck and force himself to the basket … Turns the ball over a bit too much. Small hands. Has a tendency to mishandle passes. Needs to protect the ball better. Tends to bring the ball too low after offensive rebounds, letting smaller defenders get a hand on it … A lot of his scoring comes from broken plays and put backs. His half-court offense can be predetermined. While he can score in a variety of ways at times – breaking down his defender from the perimeter, jump hook in the post, perimeter shooting – he still has a way to go to be a consistent threat from any of those areas … Tends to leave his feet a lot on defense. While he has the ability to guard the perimeter and hedge on screens, he can still improve moving his feet and keeping players in front of him.","Maker has received a lot of hype at an early age, all the way back to when he was in middle school. His combination of skills, work ethic, and height/length make him a very intriguing prospect. Translating skills into in game production at the highest level will be a heavy work in progress.","Measured 7’0.5 (with shoes) 194 lbs with a 7’2 wingspan at the 2013 LeBron James Skills Academy …

Carlisle School in Virginia, before playing his last two seasons in Canada at Orangeville Prep/Athlete Institute … Originally from South Sudan, he immigrated to Australia at the age of 5 and lived there until coming to the US in 2011 … One of the most polarizing prospects in memory, has elicited opinions all across the board by many a basketball pundit and talent evaluator … Shows some fluidity and ball skills that definitely can be worked with, though his lack of strength and understanding of the game make him a project going forward … Is an engaging person and shows an energy, competitiveness that will likely win a team over … Can reach points as a leaper that few can with a measured 12’3 max vert reach and 11’10.5 standing vert reach … A major risk if he is taken too high in the draft, but as a late 1st rounder, early 2nd rounder, there is a chance he can be developed into eventually earning a role in the league … There has been some skepticism about his true age, as is the case with many African born players, though it’s unlikely that his age is off by much if it is …  Participated in the NBA Draft Combine measurements and BAM testing but not the scrimmages

In addition, he’s an extremely low mistake player who only turned the ball over 116 times in 3081 minutes during three seasons at Virginia (1 TO per 26 minutes of play) … Full of a vast array of tricks and hesitation moves in order to draw contact on his shots … An above average athlete, Kyle tested a 36.5 vertical, a 3.06 shuttle run and a 3.28 second 3/4 court sprint … He also displays plenty of in game quickness, and extremely quick hands on the defensive end. While undersized from an NBA capacity, playing in such a team defensive system in college helped display a good defensive IQ that will help make up for his slight frame and lack of height … A 6’4.5; wingspan is also a decent measurement for a player barely over 6 feet tall … A plus rebounder for a player with his physical makeup, his 4.8 rpg mark in ACC play was actually up from his non-conference number …","The biggest and most obvious knock on Kyle Guy is just a sheer lack of both height, and muscle … At just 168.7 pounds at the combine, he was the lightest player, and would be one of the lightest players in the NBA … He’ll need to gain strength to be able to fight off, and defend NBA guards … Additionally, at 6’0.75 barefoot and 6’2.25 in shoes, he’s very undersized for an NBA shooting guard … This will hinder his effectiveness on both ends of the floor … Even in an era where combo guards are more and more apparent, Guy will need to take his ball handling from above average to good or better in order to find regular minutes on an NBA court … Despite a solid wingspan his 7’11.5 standing reach will make him very easy to shoot over for opposing players … Playing next to Ty Jerome, he didn’t need to act as a facilitator much for the Cavaliers, but improving on his ability to set up others, and acting as more of a facilitator will help his cause at the next level as well … Transitioning to a true combo guard and less of an undersized two has been a good blue print for players similar to him that have made it in the NBA, and Guy would be wise follow suit …",,"Measured 6’0.75 without shoes, 6’2.25; with shoes, 167 lbs, with a 6’4.5 wingspan and 7’11.5; standing reach at the June 2019 NBA Combine … 2019 NCAA Tournament Outstanding Player. All-ACC 1st Team (2018,2019)"," Kyle Guy is one of the best shooters in the 2019 draft, and a very heady player with an immense bag of tricks to boot. His overall appeal is hindered greatly by his smaller frame, and lack of length, but improvement as a ball handler and initiating some offense could really help his cause. Guy may or may not be drafted, but players with his range and track record of clutch moments don&#39;t come along every day. Singing him to a two way contract and seeing how he develops would be worthwhile if he doesn’t bolt overseas.

Lee took over the Commodores offense with an average of 18.6 points per game as a junior … He is an explosive player who gets to the rim at will and finishes well when he gets there. His slashing ability and playmaking are his greatest strengths as he tries to improve his perimeter shooting game … Lee averaged over four assists per game in his final season and got to the line over six times per game in his final two seasons. He improved from 67% to 75% in these attempts from the line in his final season … He is a fierce defender who averaged at least a steal per game in all three seasons at Vanderbilt. His 6’9 wingspan at only 6’2 is very enticing and combined with his speed and quickness, he looks to be a nightmare to guard on the ball and to go up against as the on-ball defender … Lee shot 55% on two-point shots as a junior showing how great he is around the rim, especially with his massive volume with 13 shots per game … Great ball-handling and quick twitches also make Lee formidable in isolations … Lee is one of the more interesting players in his class because of his long wingspan and great explosiveness. His mix of size and speed will make him a rookie to watch with such a high ceiling.","While Lee has great measurements and athleticism, his jump shot is just as unusual as his long wingspan on a small body. He shot only 33% in his three-year career and his shooting form is very unorthodox. He will certainly be a project and will have to rely on his slashing ability to make up for a lack of a jump shot early on in his career … Lee handled the ball a lot in his final season, but three turnovers per game is also hard to look past. He will have to take better care of the ball at the next level in order to get meaningful minutes … Off-ball defending became an issue a little too often and will have to improve rather quickly in his career … Lee has the quickness, but strength will be a major question mark. He will need to be able to fight through harder screens and go up with taller, stronger defenders on these drives that he was so effective with in college. He could get pushed around much more than he was at Vandy with a short off-season and less time to bulk up with a true, professional workout regimen.",,Drafted 38th in the NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons … Father is former NFL and Florida State running back Amp Lee …," Lee went with the 38th pick in the NBA Draft to the Detroit Pistons and he will join a now crowded backcourt. With experienced guards such as Derrick Rose and Delon Wright headlining the backcourt, and a lottery pick in Killian Hayes also being selected, Lee will have to fight for his minutes and will have to make palpable impacts in these limited minutes. His lack of a perimeter jumper will make this increasingly difficult and stunt his growth as a player. His physical traits give him a lot of potential, but three-pointers are growing in importance each year, and if he fails to develop an outside game, he could fall even lower on the pecking order during his rookie contract",yes,13.7,0.084,0.3,lee prolific scorer vanderbilt especially fellow star aaron nesmith went injury last season lee took commodore offense average 186 point per game junior explosive player get rim finish well get slashing ability playmaking greatest strength try improve perimeter shooting game lee averaged four assist per game final season got line six time per game final two season improved 67 75 attempt line final season fierce defender averaged least steal per game three season vanderbilt 69 wingspan 62 enticing combined speed quickness look nightmare guard ball go onball defender lee shot 55 twopoint shot junior showing great around rim especially massive volume 13 shot per game great ballhandling quick twitch also make lee formidable isolation lee one interesting player class long wingspan great explosiveness mix size speed make rookie watch high ceiling,lee great measurement athleticism jump shot unusual long wingspan small body shot 33 threeyear career shooting form unorthodox certainly project rely slashing ability make lack jump shot early career lee handled ball lot final season three turnover per game also hard look past take better care ball next level order get meaningful minute offball defending became issue little often improve rather quickly career lee quickness strength major question mark need able fight harder screen go taller stronger defender drive effective college could get pushed around much vandy short offseason le time bulk true professional workout regimen,,27.5762963,2.85,78.59244444,0.42733885,TBD,TBD,TBD,N,0.9736,1

Has good body control, adjusts well in midair. Excels in transition and plays well in the half court … Quick first step … Possesses good scoring instincts. Shoots well from different spots on the floor as well as off the dribble. Can get to the rim and be effective as a slasher … Creates offense for himself as well as teammates without over dribbling. More of a scoring guard but is developing as a playmaker. Sees the floor well and a very willing passer. Feeds the post well and passes out of drives. He can be effective regardless of who he shares the backcourt with due to his ability to alter his playing style. Scores for himself but knows how to play without the ball in his hands. Plays within the flow of the game, doesn’t force offense or let the game get away from him … Rebounds very well for a guard … Can impact the game in multiple statistical categories … Good perimeter defender. Good understanding of positioning and has the lateral speed to be effective …","Certainly best as a scoring guard, though at around 6’3 with a 6’6 wingspan, definitely would be considered undersized and could struggle defending bigger guards … While some have referred to him as a combo guard, he is not particularly comfortable setting up the offense and does not really show the vision of a primary handler … Can be a bit loose with his handle and decision making, not entirely comfortable beyond a few dribbles creating for himself … Low FT rate, while he scores from all three levels does not get to the basket often enough and can be thrown off by contact … Has struggled defending at the point of attack and on-ball, one might not be sure how versatile he is as a defender … Low steal and block rates, as well as surprisingly low rebound rate given his explosive athleticism …  Has not shown much ability in the pick-and-roll, once again leading to questions about his translating to a lead guard … Seems to be heavily reliant on his shooting at this point, which leads to questions about what he brings to the table if his shot is not falling … Has not been asked to do much off of the cut, which one might think he would be more involved in given his athletic gifts … Very little of his scoring has happened close to the basket off of the dribble, has needed someone to create those opportunities for him … As great as he has proven to be as a shooter in his freshman year, he was just an average shooter throughout his high school career, adding some skepticism about his incredible shooting accuracy at Kentucky …Monk’s developing his lead guard skills but is naturally more of an undersized scorer. Still in the process of developing his awareness of when to turn it on as a scorer and when to distribute. He can play to his strengths more, recognizing mismatches and exposing the weak link in the defense can improve … Sometimes trying too hard to run the point, passing to other players to finish in transition while he would be better off finishing himself … Can be streaky as a shooter, can improve upon consistency …","Monk is one of the most exciting players in the 2016 high school class. He will provide a one-two punch in the backcourt next year at Kentucky along with De’Aaron Fox. With the right development and improvement upon his weaknesses, he has room to move up the draft board.

Does he have the fire inside to maximize his abilities and develop a killer instinct? He has a laid back demeanor; will he continue to work hard after he starts cashing 7 figure checks? … Defensively, he’s very lax. Tends to be too upright, and should focus more on his defensive fundamentals, getting low in his defensive stance, especially on the perimeter … Has all the potential to be a lock down defender, but doesn’t put the effort in on that side of the ball … Still needs to bulk up, although he has bulked up significantly since high school. May always be skinny and adding too much weight could slow his foot speed some … Adding weight will make him more aggressive inside, as he tends to shy away from contact and can be pushed around and affected when played physical … Ball handling could still use refinement, as he is a little too high in his dribble … Shows flashes of great passing but is inconsistent … Should block more shots with his length and athleticism … Can improve upon the nuances of the game, moving without the ball, understanding where to be in help defense situations, giving equal effort on both ends of the floor etc.Double teams have proven to trouble him as he doesn’t always read them quickly enough … While he is unselfish, he lacks the passing ability to create for his teammates … To his credit his isn’t a terribly poor passer but certainly doesnt stand out at this point in his career Defensively he is improving and showing a willingness to improve, but still needs to work on his perimeter defense in terms of his anticipation skills and footwork Has a tendency of bite on fakes when going for the block, so improvement on his timing and patience will eliminate this … Like most freshmen in college Durant will need to add more weight and body strength. He probably will always be on the slim side due to his narrow chest, but it shouldn’t hinder him much except finishing inside … Doesnt always take full advantage of mismatches, often Durant will settle for the outside jumper, granted it’s not a horrible alternative … Body strength doesnt allow him to finish after contact … Despite being such a dominate offensive force, Durant can go through stretches of games where he appears fatigued and won’t demand the ball … Gets pushed out rather easily on rebounds due to his body strength … Although not a major flaw, it should be noted that Durant operate primarily on the right side of the floor … Ball protection will need to be worked on as he can get careless with the ballHis (lack of) stength is his major weakness, and he really needs to put on weight or he won’t be able to do much in the NBA except shoot deep 3s or score in transition like Darius Miles of 4 years ago … Needs to become more aggresive, develop more nastiness … Still developing a game off the dribble Defensively he needs to move his feet better and keep his hands active on the ball … Oak Hill Academy is giving him the work ethic he will need in the long run, since he most likely won’t be going to college",,"Benefited greatly from the NBAs newly implemented draft rule making high school players ineligible.

the floor if the defense over commits … Solid speed, can also drive to the rack with runners and floaters … High release on his shot, great when he is squared up to the basket and needs very little space to get his shot off … Showed definite improvement as the season went on and upped his efficiency as a shooter in conference play … His handle is improving, which should only add to his already

good condition …  Weaknesses: His shot selection was forced at times, tended to settle for off-balanced or contested attempts rather than make the extra pass … While he displays solid athleticism, he does not jump out of the gym and sometimes avoids contact … For a player with his immediate size advantage over his position at the college level, did not display much of a post game where he could use this to his advantage … His left hand will need work, was a noticeable decline when he went to the off-hand … His on-ball defense is an area he will also need to focus on, does not have great length and posted a low steal rate … Not really a player that pushes the break, plus not a very consistent finisher close to the basket … While he was a very strong defensive rebounder, did very little on the offensive glass, which would just be an added bonus and maybe a sign of ability to mix it up … Handle will still need work as far as getting the looks he did in college once he gets to the NBA … Does not have much of an ability to blow by defenders when in straight up isolation, not an incredibly quick first step and not incredibly creative as a ball handler … Had a noticeable drop-off in production against tougher competition and was sometimes bothered by lengthy defenders … Had some issues with injuries even before arriving at UNLV, season ended early due to a torn meniscus in his left knee, plus had issues with his other knee upon arriving on campus … Will need to become better at using screens and using angles to create openings around the floor … Free-throw

youth, was very college ready and showed himself to do some good things as a high volume scorer/shooter … Has really intrigued in work-outs, with visions of his ability to stretch the floor, plus the potential to contribute in other areas on offense, as well as having some potential to defend position … Making plays off of screens will be his next step, reacting quickly and choosing his spots

Thrives with the ball in his hands … Has good composure. A good decision maker and passer. Had a 2.5/1 turnover ratio as a freshman … Solid first step off the dribble and finishes well at the rim … Hits his foul shots at an effective (82%) clip … Has good strength to withstand contact and finish … Very good shooter. Despite struggling from the floor in his freshman season, shows very good form on his shot … Gets his feet set quickly. Has a clean, quick, concise release … Solid versatility to play on or off the ball. Understands how to move off the ball to get open … Good isolation ability with the ability to set his man up with crossovers and also pull up off the dribble … Has the ability to use both hands, to handle the ball and to finish … Good finisher despite lacking great explosiveness with body control and the knowledge of his to use his vody to screen shot blockers when he attacks the basket … Clutch performer, knocked down a huge step back 3 pointer in the closing minute of the Irish’ NCAA game against Xavier … Long arms help him to jump passing lanes as well as play more athletic and finish at the rim with dunks … His long arms also help him to get shots off without much daylight from a defender … Sturdy frame. Good body strength / balance. Able to change directions well … Has good blood lines. Father and Uncle were NBA twins Harvey and Horace Grant … A player who appears to be on the brink of a breakout season … Solid defensively. Doesn’t gamble much. Plays sound, fundamental defense … Generally guards the opponents 2-guard so how he can handle speedy … Capable of some highlight reel dunks, using above average leaping ability …","While a polished and athletic guard, the first thing that comes up with a player like Jerian is how much left does he have to improve … He’ll turn 23 before his first NBA game, and although I feel he’s not done developing, some may feel he lacks the ceiling of a younger player … Grant also got off to a hot start his junior year from beyond the arc before sitting out the second half of the season for academic reasons … Despite an early .408% clip, he regressed as a senior, and shot a pretty unimpressive .316% from downtown … Although Grant has good shooting ability, many of these shots were not quality shots, often coming off the dribble … He needs to adjust both his long range shot selection, and just gain more deep reps when looking towards the next level … He is also viewed as a combo guard of sorts, which isn’t a huge deal because of his positional size, if he is indeed a point guard, then he’s huge, but if he’s an off guard with some point skills, he doesn’t have that same advantage and intrigue … Improving upon the ability to set up others in the pick and roll will be important to his future …Needs to improve upon his shot selection. Forced shots far too often as a freshman. Would launch shots with a defender in his face … Shot 38% from the floor and 35% from 3, numbers that could be greatly improved with more judicious shot selection … Could be a better rebounder for a 6’5 guard at 2.9 per game in 36 mpg … With a decided size and strength advantage over competitors, he should be more aggressive at penetrating and getting to the free throw line. 4 FT attempts per game as a FR … Should learn to incorporate a floater into his game … At times he penetrates too far and get blocked by bigmen at the rim … Could stand to place more energy and emphasis his defensive game … Lacks tremendous lateral quickness to be a lockdown defender …",,"Son of former NBA player Harvey Grant, nephew of former NBA player Horace Grant, and brother of Philadelphia 76er Jerami Grant. 1st Team All-ACC 2014-15, 1st Team All-American 2014-15Son of former NBA player Harvey Grant and Nephew of Chicago Bulls standout Horace Grant … Brothers are also high level athletes: Jerami Grant (a high level recruit) will be a freshman at Syracuse, and Jaelin a prep player from the class of 2015 … Redshirted his freshmen season due to a stress fracture in his lower left leg …"," Jerian Grant could help just about any team from day 1, he’s a smart, well rounded player with highlight-reel hops (ask Tadrick Jackson), and NBA level skills at the point … His development in college leads me to believe he still has some room for growth, and his athletic ability and size is top notch … Today you’d like your guards to be a little better shooting from distance, but with some reps paired with getting used to his role in the NBA game, that could be something Grant could develop … Despite his age Grant is most definitely a first round talent, and could be a real sleeper if teams underestimate what he can do, in favor of focusing on the year he was born …Notes: Son of former NBA player Harvey Grant, nephew of former NBA player Horace Grant, and brother of Philadelphia 76er

Fearless warrior. Fierce competitor. Has a will to win. Will battle tooth and nail on every possession. Mind over matter guy who brings intangibles that don’t show up on the box score. Clutch performer who seems to shine when it matters most … A tremendous leader. Relishes the opportunity to take the club on his back and carry them to victory … Shows great consistency. Comes to play every game and had just a small handful of games where he didn’t score at least 15 points … While scoring is his forte, his ability to run the team and make plays for others, as well as maintaining above a 3-to-1 ast/to ratio is enough to label him a legitimate point guard … Has really evolved as a floor general, dictating the tempo and showing the patience to allow plays to develop and find teammates … A strong ball handler, though not elite level … Shows the ability to find teammates on drive and kicks … Tremedous in pick and roll situations … His numbers show how effective he is averaging 18.9 ppg, 47% from the floor, 39% from 3, 80% from the line, and a 6.8 to 2.2 a/to ratio … Validated his 3 point shooting ability by hitting a high volume (2 per game) … Has a surprising 6’5 wingspan, giving him some additional length to get shots off and finish at the rim … A pesky defender showing excellent ability to anticipate an opposing guard’s next move and get his hands in to strip the ball away … Shows solid body strength giving him the ability to stay on balance when contact occurs and finish off drives … Very effective in catch and shoot situations, playing off the ball … Also tremendous pulling up for shots off the dribble …","Undersized for the PG position and could struggle some to compete with bigger, quicker and more athletic point guards at the NBA level … Scouts worry that he may run into similar problems as 2011 top 10 pick Kemba Walker: having many passes deflected due to his size and having to work twice as hard (defensively and getting shots off) on a game to game basis due to his size. Can he be a starting PG, and if so can he do it on on a winning team? Due to being undersized, these questions must be asked … He doesn’t show the jitterbug quickness to gain separation on quicker guards which is a concern considering his size … Not the most athletic guard. Solid but not spectacular. Not a player that will dunk in traffic or be a dynamic finisher … His numbers show that he’s more effective in the half court than in transition … A better scorer than distributor, though his vision and passing ability shows flashes … Despite averaging 6.8 apg, scouts aren’t completely sold on his vision and ability to make everyone around him better … Needs to work on his pick and roll skills … As clutch a player as he is, his ISO ability is compromised by a lack of elite speed off the dribble and average first step … Much more effective going to his right. Will need to work on using his left hand and ability to go left in order for team’s not to overplay him to one side, limiting his effectiveness … Should look to add a tear drop to his arsenal. He won’t always be able to get shots off close to the rim, so adding an effective runner will help him when attacking the paint at the next level …",,"Measured 6’0 (in shoes) 185 lbs, with a 6’5 wingspan at the 2012 Deron Williams Skills Academy … Was arguably the best player in the nation as a sophomore and deserves strong consideration for National Player of the Year, he has our vote … Grew up playing basketball in Ohio with Jared Sullinger and the pair won numerous State titles and AAU events together … Has a chance to be a top 10 pick after a very impressive sophomore season and NCAA tournament and the level of interest that scouts have shown …",,yes,13.8,0.06,1.7,point guard tremendous heart determination many cliche attribute fit natural born killer fearless warrior fierce competitor win battle tooth nail every possession mind matter guy brings intangible dont show box score clutch performer seems shine matter tremendous leader relish opportunity take club back carry victory show great consistency come play every game small handful game didnt score least 15 point scoring forte ability run team make play others well maintaining 3to1 astto ratio enough label legitimate point guard really evolved floor general dictating tempo showing patience allow play develop find teammate strong ball handler though elite level show ability find teammate drive kick tremedous pick roll situation number show effective averaging 189 ppg 47 floor 39 3 80 line 68 22 ato ratio validated 3 point shooting ability hitting high volume 2 per game surprising 65 wingspan giving additional length get shot finish rim pesky defender showing excellent ability anticipate opposing guard next move get hand strip ball away show solid body strength giving ability stay balance contact occurs finish drive effective catch shoot situation playing ball also tremendous pulling shot dribble,undersized pg position could struggle compete bigger quicker athletic point guard nba level scout worry may run similar problem 2011 top 10 pick kemba walker many pass deflected due size work twice hard defensively getting shot game game basis due size starting pg winning team due undersized question must asked doesnt show jitterbug quickness gain separation quicker guard concern considering size athletic guard solid spectacular player dunk traffic dynamic finisher number show he effective half court transition better scorer distributor though vision passing ability show flash despite averaging 68 apg scout arent completely sold vision ability make everyone around better need work pick roll skill clutch player iso ability compromised lack elite speed dribble average first step much effective going right need work using left hand ability go left order team overplay one side limiting effectiveness look add tear drop arsenal wont always able get shot close rim adding effective runner help attacking paint next level,,34.51035653,1.4,48.31449915,0.364503844,N,Y,MID,N,0.9759,1

At a chiseled 6’6 220 with large wingspan. Possesses the prototypical frame for an NBA wing …Incredible leaper and explosive finisher. Vertical is reportedly 40 inches plus … His head is even with the rim on many of his dunks … Has all but mastered the art of the mid-range game … Shoots the ball exceptionally well from inside 20 feet. At his best with one dribble and then elevating, preferably to his left … Moves well without the ball, always looking for creases in the defense … Uses screens well and comes off ready to fire … Puts his unique package of leaping ability and strength to good use on the glass … Excellent offensive rebounder (2.4 per game) … Finishes strong around the basket, but shows finesse and variety with floaters and spin moves … Right hand dominant when attacking the hoop. Defenders know this, but he still gets to the rack, a testament to his first step and strength … Puts in a strong effort on the defensive end … Above average lateral quickness, but often too high in his defensive stance.

Does not look to dominate … His on court presence leaves much to be desired at this stage of his development .. He plays hard, but rarely full throttle … Passion to be a superstar has always been questioned .. Needs to enhance range on his jumper … Shot only 17% from three in his one season at USC, attempting only 1 per game … He steps into his mid-range jumper well, but tends to fade away on three point attempts … Despite a picturesque stroke, shot only 65% from the FT line … His ball handling needs a lot of work … Rarely, if ever, takes more than one dribble to his left without pulling up or spinning back right … Very predictable. Lacks creativity in the face up game which he will need to succeed at the next level … Despite his size and strength, he did not utilize the post up game at all in college. Not much of a passer or facilitator (1.5 assists per game) … Has a quick first step, but not dynamic … His ceiling is unlimited, but needs to add many significant dimensions to his game. A year older than his freshman counterparts, turning 20 in August.Needs to become more consistent overall. Does not always play up to his abilities Must gain experience and develop more of a killer instinct. He’s competitive, but can go through the motions when he’s not on his game Has superstar potential, but must continue to work hard and not buy into his own hype to get there His ability to set up teammates and passing game could show some improvement Must learn to play with more intensity defensively His outside shot has become reliable but his midrange game can still improve His first steep is good, but not as quick as some of the NBA’s top 2-guards.

come out of college basketball in recent memory … This past season as a junior, he won his second national championship, earned AP Player of the Year honors and the Wooden Award … Brunson started 115 games at one of the top college programs in the country in Villanova and is an NBA-ready guard with great maturity and basketball IQ for the point guard spot … He was highly productive in his final season, averaging 18.9 points and 4.6 assists as a junior while shooting 52.1 percent from the field and 40.8 percent from the three-point line … There are very few questions about Brunson’s leadership/ intensity / and pure basketball skills … He is an outstanding leader on the court and makes everyone around him better … Brunson can score at all three levels and be a quality facilitator of the basketball as well … While lacking elite size and explosiveness for an NBA lead guard, Brunson has the skill and craftiness to somewhat make up for it … He has the full arsenal of moves on offense … He is left-handed, which is already more difficult to guard in and of itself because defenders aren’t as used to guarding them … Brunson also moves without the ball very well and cuts with purpose to look for angles where he might be open to catch a pass in open areas … He is excellent at advancing the ball with a sense of urgency to spark the break … He consistently has his head up early in the backcourt and is willing to skip the ball ahead to the open man in transition … Brunson also has a very strong fundamental game on the defensive end … His footwork is very good … He understands how to use his body … He is willing to play with physicality … He anticipates, sees the floor and understands how to play in the team defensive concept … With all of that said, Brunson will still have to prove that he can keep NBA point guards in front of him … He also protects the ball by shielding it with his body and by using his strength … Brunson plays with a steady pace, changes gears and directions very well and creates space by initiating contact, all of which helps when penetrating the defense to score or kick to an open teammate … He has very good court vision and the instincts to see and deliver pinpoint cross-court passes or cunning bounce passes to open cutters … Brunson’s strength and decisiveness allows him to finish effectively around the rim, too, and he makes use of jab-steps and pump-fakes regularly, often times making strong and creative drives to the rim while staying low to the ground before taking off and finishing the play when he’s created the right angle … Brunson is comfortable finishing with either hand and is crafty in transition … He regularly utilizes Euro-steps and other advanced footwork moves while attacking from smart angles to get a high percentage shot off …","The defensive end is where the most questions will arise for Brunson … In today’s NBA, most teams prefer to play lineups that are extremely versatile and switchable on the defensive end … It is far too easy for teams to force switches and get the match-ups they want … Brunson could be a liability in this regard if things go poorly … To be even more clear, Brunson projects as a player who can only defend one position, the point guard position, and it is not 100 percent clear that Brunson would be successful defending starting NBA point guards … The fact is that most players Brunson defends, even without getting switched on to wings or bigs, will be both bigger (longer) and faster than Brunson … While Brunson is an unselfish player, he has a tendency to at times over-dribble while probing the defense, which leads to turnovers … If he can develop a more consistent floater and pull-up mid-range jumper it would help to make decision making simpler while opening up angles to the rim while making him a more versatile scorer … The defensive end is where Brunson must make strides to prove to scouts that he hs what it takes to excel in the NBA … Brunson’s lateral quickness, effort, and willingness to contest shots left a lot to be desired, which is concerning considering his relative pedestrian physical tools … When projecting to the next level it’s necessary for Brunson’s stock that he proves to be a capable defender since he’ll have to stay in front of the best playmakers in the world at the NBA level …",,"Son of former NBA player Rick Brunson

He should be able to extend out to NBA 3 point range without much difficulty …","Due to being an unheralded recruit, may take some time to establish himself within the Notre Dame program … Currently a bench player, fighting for minutes (19 mpg) through consistent and mistake free play, instead of having the luxury to play more freely and make mistakes … Shows a great deal of potential, but is still in a sticky spot for being a one-and-done as he has players that have more seniority and experience in front of him on the Irish depth chart, and Notre Dame obviously has a vested interest in his returning next season … Needs to learn how to move better off the ball. Stay in motion more and set up defenders to run them off screens with timing … At 185 lbs, could stand to add an additional 10-15 lbs, an NBA weight training program will help him add core strength and become better balanced and able to withstand contact from opponents and finish through fouls around the rim … Hitting just 65% on FTs through five games. His shooting motion should allow him to be an 80%+ FT shooter eventually,","Projects as a two year lottery pick with a chance to go as high as top 5 with two years at Notre Dame. With 2022 being seen as a weak draft, there will likely be the opportunity for him to enter as a one-and-done and could go as high as 10-20 range if he continues on his current progression … Wesley has two way star potential for the NBA level, but needs to continue to develop and put in the work to get there.

he makes good cuts going to the basket and knows how to find the openings off drive & dish or pick & roll situations … His ability to catch difficult passes in traffic also makes him a good passing target inside … Once his catches the ball close to the hoop, he is an extremely efficient finisher, because he knows how to utilize his length and leaping ability … He is able to do some damage on the low block because of his reach and athleticism, but he is most effective when facing up, because he can use his quickness to get by opposing bigs … He is a decent rebounder, and when he makes up his mind to go get the ball, he becomes a threat on both ends of the floor … Has the potential to become an impact player on the defensive end, where his wingspan could wreak havoc in the passing lanes and in the blocked shots department …","Despite a high ceiling, Jones doesn’t have a go-to part of his game that can be a reliable weapon night in and night out… Frustratingly inconsistent, and can disappear throughout stretches of a game … Skinny frame, not comfortable or strong enough defending the low post… Struggles to create easy shots for himself …  Only attempted 3 foul shots a game… Sub-par three-point shooter through two years at the college level… Lacks a true position … Poor rebounding numbers reflect how easily he gets pushed around under the boards… Hasn’t yet figured out just when and how to take advantage of his physical tools and skill-set … Only .6 blocks per game with his size and quickness shows he lacks defensive awareness … Toughness has been questioned…Even with all of his tools and upside, he’s still a project and very much an unpolished product … He had a solid first season, but still fell short of the expectations and hype he had coming out of high school (part of the problem were the system and his teammates who were less than willing to get him the ball) … A big question mark is his demanor and approach to the game, too many times he is satisfied by just coasting and taking the easy route … The lack of strength and unwillingness to play to contact further add to his somewhat soft label … His lanky frame and high center of gravity allow much smaller players to body and push him off balance and he does not show the willingness to battle back … Finishing off the dribble is also a problem because any bump from a defender throws him out of stride and he is more willing to take an off balance shot rather than one through contact … He is still very young in terms of his development age and it shows in his careless and lackadaisical play with the ball … Lacking the savvy and understanding of angles, he has a hard time finding his passing target on a regular basis … His jumpshot has a lot of promise, but it is a bit of a mystery; he seems to have a fairly smooth stroke, his release shows fluidity and he has a nice rhythm shooting off the dribble or on the move, however the results and consistency are lacking … His potential in terms of rebounding and defense is unlimited, he has the tools to defend all five positions and the athleticism to get his hands on a high percentage of missed shots, however, at this point in his career he does not show the willingness to defend or rebound on a regular basis …  He sometimes tries to do too much, which at the high school level is completely fine because of his talent … However, as he grows up and plays at higher levels he will have to learn to work with his teammates and improve his basketball IQ in this area if he expects to be a star … He is special with the ball in his hands but isn’t all that helpful when that’s not the case … His length makes him intimidating on defense but he doesn’t give maximum effort on this side of the ball … He will often coast on plays, standing on the three-point line waiting for the ball … He can shoot from the perimeter but isn’t yet consistent … Is expected to play a good deal in the post in his senior year at Duncanville, so his development on the perimeter (his long term position is small forward) will likely come in college …",,"Due to “impermissible benefits” he was declared ineligible near the end of the season.  As a result, if he was to come back to school next year, he would have to miss 5 games and pay back $700.

One year ago he was a great prospect capable of dominating his age group but lacked the skills and experience to play against professionals. He has really come a long way in a short time. His numbers are completely mind blowing to Europeans. Playing in the Greek League which is the 3-4th best league in all of Europe, Sophocles averaged 11 points 6 rebounds in 21.5 minutes in 23 games. He shot 58% from the field and had more offensive rebounds than defensive 3.3 to 3. He totaled five doudle doubles, with his best game 20p 11r against Panionios.Dimitris Armadoros – 1/1/2003Strengths: A Greek Baby Shaq? A super prospect with developing offensive skills. He plays with aggressiveness, intelligence. a solid inside game with post moves, baby hooks, and his shot from the 16-18 feet is excellent. Unselfish player with great agility. He sets up screens extremely well. Has the smooth moves of a forward combined with muscles that allow him to be dominant on the boards. He jumps impetuously for rebounds, both on offense and defense. He can handle the ball well from the one paint to the other. His approach to devloping his game is very mature.","Has a bad habit of picking up quick fouls due to over aggressiveness when guarding his man Needs to work on recognizing double teams better as he is often slow to react to them Fundamentally he is a little behind in his development as he has had to play out of position for his team Offensively he still has a tendency to rely too much on his back to the basket power game instead of concentrating on face up skills Height is inflated, although Schortsanitis is listed by “some” at 6′11″, he looks to be between 6′8″ to 6′9″ Despite his ability to draw contact in the lane, his below average free throw shooting inhibits him from taking full advantage of his opportunities While he has range on his jumper, he lacks consistency Tends to put the ball on the floor rather than immediately going up with the ball after receiving it in the post Although a solid rebounder he is still learning how to get rebounds out of position although with added game experience this should be less of an issue Defensively he is not a great shot blocker as he is still learning defensive footwork and timingInexperience. Must stay focused. Gets into foul trouble easily (mainly due to his passion to play good defense). Needs to work more on his free throws in order not to face problems in the future. Still has a ways to go in terms of development, but with such a strong work ethic, there’s no telling how good he can be. Still isn’t asked much of because he is playing against much older and more experienced players. He is being nurtured along slowly to best facilitate his skills and potential.

Son of a Greek father and a Cameroonian mother, Schortsanitis impressed last year Iraklis American player, Tony Farmer ( former Golden State Warriors Forward), who gave him the name Baby Shaq, because of his beast-strength and his inside game. Another impressive element of his game is his fighting spirit on defense. He is a quick learner and a pearly character. He will probably be a 7 footer of 280 pounds full of muscles and strength. Schortsanitis will benefit greatly from the fact that he has competed against professionals in a very tough league from age 15. He has similar game to Eddy Curry of the Chicago Bulls. Right now, he is a “Baby-Shaq” that spends hours upon hours in the gym lifting weights or training both with the youngs and the pro players.",,yes,,,,solid athlete run floor well posse average leaping ability strength able get excellent position block size show great agility around basket good job drawing contact lane importantly contact occurs strength body control finish shown ability hit 1819 foot jumper needed soft hand allow catch pass thrown post play every game passion intensity player easily intimidated due aggressiveness size great offensive rebounder solid passer player size age although decision making still work progress tipins layins display soft touch around basket defensively quick hand capable intercepting pass smart defender often allow man front pas made enough quickness quickly jump front steal owns solid work ethicand desire great goodweaknesses bad habit picking quick foul due aggressiveness guarding man need work recognizing double team better often slow react fundamentally little behind development play position team offensively still tendency rely much back basket power game instead concentrating face skill height inflated although schortsanitis listed 611 look 68 69 despite ability draw contact lane average free throw shooting inhibits taking full advantage opportunity range jumper lack consistency tends put ball floor rather immediately going ball receiving post although solid rebounder still learning get rebound position although added game experience le issue defensively great shot blocker still learning defensive footwork timingnotes schortsanitis made enormous stride last year one year ago great prospect capable dominating age group lacked skill experience play professional really come long way short time number completely mind blowing european playing greek league 34th best league europe sophocles averaged 11 point 6 rebound 215 minute 23 game shot 58 field offensive rebound defensive 33 3 totaled five doudle double best game 20p 11r panioniosdimitris armadoros 112003strengths greek baby shaq super prospect developing offensive skill play aggressiveness intelligence solid inside game post move baby hook shot 1618 foot excellent unselfish player great agility set screen extremely well smooth move forward combined muscle allow dominant board jump impetuously rebound offense defense handle ball well one paint approach devloping game mature,bad habit picking quick foul due aggressiveness guarding man need work recognizing double team better often slow react fundamentally little behind development play position team offensively still tendency rely much back basket power game instead concentrating face skill height inflated although schortsanitis listed 611 look 68 69 despite ability draw contact lane average free throw shooting inhibits taking full advantage opportunity range jumper lack consistency tends put ball floor rather immediately going ball receiving post although solid rebounder still learning get rebound position although added game experience le issue defensively great shot blocker still learning defensive footwork timinginexperience must stay focused get foul trouble easily mainly due passion play good defense need work free throw order face problem future still way go term development strong work ethic there telling good still isnt asked much playing much older experienced player nurtured along slowly best facilitate skill potential could closer 68 16 figure continue grow,,0.0,2.65,0.0,TBD,Y,Y,Y,TBD,0.9763,1

He attempted just eight jump shots on the season, and looked very mechanical when doing so … There isn’t a whole lot of fluidity in his jump shot, and his 53.5% shooting from the free-throw line suggests that he does not have great upside as a stretch forward … Anigbogu is similarly unrefined in the post … Despite his size and strength, he shot just 30.4% on post-up opportunities, despite using a sizable portion of his half-court offense on the block … His lack of touch again comes into play here, but his unrefined footwork is a big factor in his ineffectiveness as well … Anigbogu can become predictable in the post, as he is limited to mostly simple jump hooks and turnarounds … His hands are not secure and he fumbles away far too many easy catches and rebounds … He also becomes very turnover prone when doubled in the post, turning the ball over on nearly 18% of his post-up possessions, which is nearly as often as the 25% at which he scores … Another issue he has is that he can be too aggressive in seeking out opportunities to block shots … Anigbogu has a tendency to find himself out of position as he chases shots he has little to no chance of getting to … While his constant motor and activity level are things to be valued, he’ll have to work on harnessing his aggression and continue to develop his overall recognition, awareness, and communication defensively in order to make the most of his physical gifts … His 7.6 fouls for per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, say a lot about his lack of defensive discipline … Even though it takes six fouls in the NBA before disqualification, he will need to improve in this area to stay on the court for longer stretches … One more area he could improve on is on the defensive glass, as he hauled in just 19.9% of the available defensive rebounds while he was on the court … His activity as a shot blocker hinders him somewhat in this regard, but his overall awareness can get better … He is capable of rebounding out of his area because of his physical tools, but he needs to do a better job of being in position to haul in defensive rebounds …",,"Measured 6′ 8.5” barefoot, 6′ 9.75” in shoes, 252.2 lbs, 7′ 6.25”

201153,Julian Wright,2007,1,13,13,Draft,1610612740,New Orleans,Hornets,NOH,Kansas,College/University,1,Julian,Wright,,,94.0,," Can create mismatches all over the floor with his size and point guard skills, i.e. dribbling and passing. Can take bigger guys off the dribble and post up smaller players. Able to play the finesse game as well as be a bull in the post. Very tough minded, which is a misconception based upon his slight frame. Led the Jayhawks in rebounding his sophomore year by a wide margin with 7.8 per game, with the next highest total being 5.6 rpg. Improved in every statistical category his sophomore year besides blocks, which stayed on pace at 1.3 per game. A very hard worker, evidenced by his statistical climb from freshman to sophomore year and the noticeable improvement on his jumpshot. Capable of making eye popping plays either as a distributor, a finisher and also on the defensive end of the floor. A great personality in the locker room, any team looking to change the attitude in the locker room or strengthen team chemistry would be doing themselves a disservice by overlooking him. A player capable of filling up the stat sheet; Kirilenko-esque.Weaknesses: First and foremost, his jumpshot. While it is undoubtedly improved, there is still much work to be done. With a reliable jumpshot that defenders would have to respect, the damage Julian could do to opposing defenses would jump tenfold. Also alarming is Julians performance at the 2007 combine where he came in 66th in total athleticism. Especially startling is his performance in the bench press drills where he could only lift the 185 pound bar twice. After two full years with a major collegiate teams strength program, one would think he would be able to lift more than two reps. Also, which position does Julian fit in the pros? He is a quick four? A big three? It would come down to team need I believe and offensive philosophy.Conclusion: On the right team, Julians style of play could ignite a teams offense. His long arms, he measured in with a 72 wingspan and a 9 standing reach at the combine, allow his to play bigger than he really is and equip him to play frustrating on the ball defense. While his lack of strength might raise some red flags, it never seemed to be an issue while playing at Kansas, where he faced first class talent on an almost nightly basis. Patience is the key with Julian; once he figures out his role on the team and what he is capable of, and also if he is ever able to consistently knock down his outside jumpers, then the dividends of his game will unfold.Matthew Maurer – 12/22/2006Strengths: For his size, he is a tremendous passer able to make impressive plays Unselfish player who gets his teammates involved in the offense … Excellent court vision, sees the floor with ease Smart player who doesnt force things. Waits and lets the game come to him Possesses the ball handling ability to take most opposing forwards to the basket Has a quick first step which allows him to gain separation from his defender Combine that with his assortment of crossovers and change of speed dribbles Excellent athlete who is a great finisher in transition He possesses long arms and quickness which enables him to disrupt passing lanes Adequate shot blocker who is a threat as a help defender thanks to his solid lateral movement Has improved greatly as a rebounder by improving his fundamentals instead of just relying on his athleticism as he previously had Clearly has expanded his shooting from mid-range and has the ability to hit from the perimeter His versatility creates mismatches for opposing teams While his skill set reminds you of a finesse forward, he is a tough minded player who doesnt shy away from contactWeaknesses: Can almost be unselfish to a fault in that he doesnt take control of the game offensively Must continue to increase his upper body strength to aid him in finishing after contact occurs Perimeter shooting is a work in progress. While Wright has the ability, he remains streaky Still isnt what you would call a consistent performer, often he will follow one spectacular performance with several sub par games Has a habit of going for the spectacular pass which can cause turnovers Adding improved back to the basket skills would allow for him to really expand his offensive game Free throw shooting continues to improve but remains a work in progressRob Salvador – 9/21/2004Strengths: A high riser with gifted all around athleticism … Loves using his hops to attack the basket … At his best when he’s around the rim, where his athleticism, size, and incredible wingspan make him a dangerous weapon … An excellent offensive rebounder, leading to a lot of tip ins, and easy baskets … Also adept with his back towards the basket, where he can use his size to create easy shots for himself … An incredible slasher with tremendous balance and body control … Loves the open floor game… Very quick first step allows for easy penetration, and being an incredible finisher he usually scores when he gets to the basket … Unlike most 6’8 players, Julian is a terrific ball handler, and often brings the ball up and leads the break for his team… Played point guard during his junior year at Homewood Flossmoor… Unselfish player with good court vision … His size allows for excellent passing ability, and he usually finds the open teammate … Good rebounder, mostly due to his size and athletic ability … His long arms (7’1 wingspan) lead to lots of steals and blocked shots … Defense is solid and has great potential …","First and foremost, his jumpshot.

He’s a full year younger than Canadian phenom Andrew Wiggins. Has been compared to Tyreke Evans, but is more talented. Great upside. Playmaker who can score and make others better. The sky is the limit if  he is willing to work. Has the natural talent and feel for the game that can make him the # 1 player in the country by the time he’s a senior. With continued development looking at a top 5 pick and franchise player at the highest level.","Has struggled with his midrange and outside shooting, often off balance or struggles with timing to release the ball at the highest point of his jump … In a small sample size (13-38 3PT, 27-47 FT), only shot 34.2% from 3-point range and 57.4% from the FT stripe and will need to work on improving those numbers to keep defenses honest … Will settle for bad shots, plus will sometimes be unnecessarily off balanced on good looks … Must improve his confidence and consistency as a shooter … Still has a tendency to depend on the dribble too much, be careless with the ball and go for the highlight rather than settling for a more calculated decision … Had 5.9 apg: 3.25 topg, and while a 1.82 assist-to-turnover ratio is not terrible for a player his age, he definitely needs to cut down his turnovers to be an effective NBA PG … Sometimes has lapses when he is off the ball on defense, plus needs to be more consistent in getting low in his stance … Some of his worst games were against the more established Pro/NBA players, so will still likely need some work before being completely ready to help a team win consistently … Can be even more effective if he worked on his skills off of the ball, where he could be a strong cutter in time … His decision to play overseas in China makes him much more of a mystery to NBA teams, and also decreased his development over the past year … Suffered a severe ankle sprain while in China, seems to have recuperated fully, will just need to monitor this and look at future injury prevention … Seeing that he is the first high level US player to go directly to the Chinese Basketball Association, it is really difficult to tell what his numbers mean in relation to the top NCAA and even European prospects who have more of a sample size, could possibly affect where he goes in the draft … For a player who attacks and gets to the basket as often as he did, did not get to the line at a great rate, which will be something that will be crucial to his success in the NBA …Very streaky shooter … Needs to develop a consistent midrange shot …Takes too long to get shot off … Must become a better free throw shooter … Sometimes too flashy and tries hard to make the big play which leads to turnovers … Occasionally over dribbles … Should become more of a vocal leader … Needs to stay in a stance on defense and close out low with hands high …",,"Was born in Kinshasa, Zaire (now known as Democratic Republic of Congo), though settled in Arlington, Texas

Measured 6’5 (in shoes) 200 lbs, with a 6’8.5 wingspan and 8’4.5 standing reach at the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit … Played his first two seasons at Arlington’s Grace Prep, than his last two at Prime Prep in Dallas … Won consecutive TAPPS titles playing with former Baylor player Isaiah Austin during his freshman and sophomore year at Grace Prep … Team at Prime Prep went 67-7 and during his junior and senior seasons … Participated in the 2014 McDonald’s All-American Game, Jordan Brand Classic and Nike Hoop Summit … Scored 20 points to lead the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit in scoring, along with 2 rebounds and 3 assists … Was originally committed to Southern Methodist University, where he would have played for coach Larry Brown … Decided to forego college, signing with the Guangdong Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association for a reported 1.2 million dollars … Played 12 games during his time with Guangdong, averaging 18 ppg on 47.8% FG/34.2% 3PT/57.4% FT, 6.3 rpg (2 orpg), 5.9 apg (3.25 topg) and 1.6 spg in 31.5 mpg, his team going 9-3 in those games … Suffered a severely sprained right ankle, which kept him out of game action for just over 3 months, before playing in Guangdong’s final two games of the season in the play-offs … Jump shot does not appear to be broken, will just need further repetitions, confidence and is best when he is on balance … Has explosive ability to be a threat off the drive, yet also has very strong court vision and is an unselfish player … Seems to have taken to being a professional quite seriously and even if the strength of play in China is questioned by some, few can argue that he was not tested physically and seemed to rise to that challenge well … With his size and speed, already a tough match-up and could become a special point guard with his top notch athleticism and ability to see the court … Considered to be a “mysterious” potential draftee due to how unique his situation was as far as going from High School to China, though was considered a top high school prospect who likely would have dominated immediately had he stepped onto a college campus … There is a risk in the unknown, but Mudiay certainly was a player tracked by NBA scouts for years and followed closely in China … If he can become a more consistent shooter, he could become one of the NBA’s top point guards, with enough versatility to affect games even if his shot does not ever become high level … Had he not gotten injured and provided a more full sample size during his time in China, might have still been in contention for the top pick, certainly one of the higher upside talents in the 2015 NBA Draft …Born in the Republic of Congo  Wes Hinton 1/6/14Measured 6’4.5 (in shoes) 187 lbs, with a 6’7 wingspan at the 2011 LeBron James Skills Academy … Measured 6’5 (in shoes) 188 lbs, with a 6’7.5 wingspan at the 2013 Nike Guard Skills Academy", Emmanuel Mudiay is arguably the top point guard in the class of 2014 and will almost certainly be a one and done player.  Under the tutelage of Larry Brown at SMU his decision making will undoubtedly improve and he will learn how to run a team in the half court.

While some scouts are extremely high on him, there are just as many that question his focus and passion for the game … Often plays too upright on offense, which can get him off his base and lead to turnovers … Needs to work on moving without the ball, has a reputation of sometimes standing, ball watching … Defensive awareness is something he must work on, along with always running out to his spot and not relying completely on length, athleticism to challenge a player … Still needs to add upper body strength, had issues finishing around the basket and getting knocked off of his spot when defensive rebounding … Long range shot is still not overly consistent, sometimes turns his hand outward on follow through … Often loose with dribble, sometimes has the ball too high and gets exploited when double teamed … Some question his lack of assertiveness offensively, which calls into question his ability to be a primary option on a high level team … Battled inconsistency and struggled against physical defense, which could point to strength as well as a sign of shaky confidence … Should look to become a more vocal leader … Too often settled for long range shots and did not venture out of his comfort zone enough, still has many things to learn in terms of creating mid range shots and counter moves … Had a difficult time establishing post position, something that could be a crucial next step to utilize his quickness and size as a wing at the next level … Has been compared to Kobe Bryant, but the biggest difference appears to be the attention to detail. So far, granted Kobe’s is extremely rare, Wiggins has been lacking in this area. Will he develop this critical aspect in order to polish his all around game to achieve greatness?Despite having immense skill and athletic abilities for a player of his age, there are still several concerns from people who watch him with regularity … Looks complacent at times on the court … Inconsistent motor … Needs to add more strength, though his body looks very good for a player his age, and this shouldn’t be a problem in a few years … Ball-handling ability is unrefined, but has a lot of potential … Doesn’t display a lot of toughness and isn’t a very physical player … He’s been receiving a considerable amount of hype on a multi-national scale since he was 13 years of age, which can derail the development of a prospect as it can lead to him trying to be a big celebrity instead of a great basketball player …",,"Hype and expectations were enormous for his freshmen season, and he finished as a consensus 2nd Team All-American with averages of 17.1 ppg and 5.9 rpg … Even through ups and downs during his short time at Kansas, he showed glimpses of having exceptional potential as an NBA wing player … Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Wiggins has done very well when representing Canada in International competitions, going 2-0 as part of the World Team in the Nike Hoop Summit, averaging 18.5 ppg and 8 rpg … Shows enough athleticism and versatility to possibly play both wing positions, could become a match-up nightmare … The sky is the limit for him, as he’s been blessed with the type of athleticism that does not come along in every class. Considered by some as the best athlete to surface in 10 years, since LeBron James. Will he develop the work ethic to maximize those abilities is the question … A virtual lock as a top 3 pick with a chance to go first depending on who gets the selection …Measured 6’7 (in shoes) 190 lbs, with a 6’11 wingspan at the 2011 LeBron James Skills Academy … Measured 6’7 (in shoes) 196 lbs, with a 6’11 wingspan at the 2012 LeBron James Skills Academy"," Wiggins has an unreal amount of potential and he’ll be under the eye of every scout over the next few years … Considered the top player in his class by most recruiting services, and has 1st overall pick potential whenever he enters the NBA draft …",yes,14.8,0.057,3.0,chart runjump athleticism lateral quickness length also give great potential perimeter defender along versatility guard wing position efficiently incredibly dangerous transition opportunity long strider quick first step great job scoring getting fouled getting transition shooting mechanic improved greatly quickness enough get shot tight defense got ft stripe good rate making 775 attempt offensive rebounder keep possession alive others due second jump tremendous leaping ability challenged defensively kansa often asked guard team leading scorer wing admirable job unselfish look teammate evolving playmaker spin move become major weapon isolation plus shown floater time could become weapon closely defended step back jumper also move tough guard play quiet intensity question lack emotion also never get challenged shown ability step challenge son former nba player olympic sprinter understanding game knowledge get court conditioning fantastic played major minute freshman able carry solid work load immediately ability run floor elite ensures certain level success nba level skinny broad shoulder add weight he determined showed increased understanding role got much lower defense year progressed kansa look quite coachable aside poor final tournament game seemed playing best basketball season came close including huge 40 plus point breakout performance west virginia freakishly gifted athlete remarkably smooth offensive game impossible guard level due athletic ability effortlessly glide around defender play quick first step long stride explosive athleticism paint either leap defense soft runner throw electric dunk either way generally highpercentage shot great size either wing position frame capable holding good amount weight long wingspan recently measured 611 fantastic shooter perimeter already nba range quick trigger beautiful shot mechanic ball isnt hand like spot corner get open shot cut baseline alleyoop play also ability create separation dribble pullup jumper good passing instinct court vision defensively get lot deflection us length anticipation come lot steal block father played nba extremely young get better time,biggest issue whether wiggins mental make maximize immense physical gift scout extremely high many question focus passion game often play upright offense get base lead turnover need work moving without ball reputation sometimes standing ball watching defensive awareness something must work along always running spot relying completely length athleticism challenge player still need add upper body strength issue finishing around basket getting knocked spot defensive rebounding long range shot still overly consistent sometimes turn hand outward follow often loose dribble sometimes ball high get exploited double teamed question lack assertiveness offensively call question ability primary option high level team battled inconsistency struggled physical defense could point strength well sign shaky confidence look become vocal leader often settled long range shot venture comfort zone enough still many thing learn term creating mid range shot counter move difficult time establishing post position something could crucial next step utilize quickness size wing next level compared kobe bryant biggest difference appears attention detail far granted kobe extremely rare wiggins lacking area develop critical aspect order polish around game achieve greatnessdespite immense skill athletic ability player age still several concern people watch regularity look complacent time court inconsistent motor need add strength though body look good player age shouldnt problem year ballhandling ability unrefined lot potential doesnt display lot toughness isnt physical player he receiving considerable amount hype multinational scale since 13 year age derail development prospect lead trying big celebrity instead great basketball player,,59.69230769,1.0,59.69230769,0.454051153,N,N,MID,N,0.9771,1
1630536,Sharife Cooper,2021,2,18,48,Draft,1610612737,Atlanta,Hawks,ATL,Auburn,College/University,1,Sharife,Cooper,,,89.0,,"A highly talented, creative lead guard prospect who excels as a playmaker with the ball in his hands … A true maestro as a floor general with the type of blow-by quickness, ball-handling ability and speed you’d expect from a diminutive PG, Cooper has consistently shown outstanding passing instincts, unselfishness and vision throughout his amateur career … Doesn’t take him long at all to find the open man and, like many other great playmakers before him, his eyes are always up and never looking at the floor … Plays with great anticipation skills, often seeing and making plays before they unfold or the defense has time to react … Very good at subtly looking off defenders and tilting the defense one way, and then going another way with the ball … Was a high usage player who assisted on 52% of Auburn’s scoring when he was on the court as a Fr. (8.1 APG), which is outstanding, and creates a ton of open jump shots and lobs at the rim … Reads help defense very well and delivers accurate, needle-threading passes even against hard hedges from bigs … Occupies double teams and traps by keeping his dribble alive and patiently finding open players … Equally effective passing, slashing and finishing with his left hand as he is with his right … Simply makes everyone’s job easier with the ball in his hands, whether making well timed full-court passes in transition before the defense is set, as a ball-handler in the pick and roll or finding and rewarding cutting teammates for easy scores … Routinely leads teammates in stride with his passes, especially in pick and roll situations, and truly has uncanny timing and court awareness … Has no problem getting into the teeth of the defense with his quick 1st step, and also shows a good command of hesitation moves and crossovers, switching up his pace to lull defenders when necessary … Shows nice footwork in the lane, and the groundwork is there for him to keep improving his in-between game, because he shows flashes of floaters, up-and-unders, and teardrops in his repertoire that will be necessary considering his lack of size … Was a 20 ppg scorer as a Fr., largely out of necessity but you still cant overlook his willingness to score, his adequate finishing ability (for his size) and ability to take advantage of the defense worrying about him driving to dish … The amount of pressure he applies when driving and his surprising willingness to put up shots through contact is heavily reflected in his high FTA rate (8.6 per game), and he converted on a very nice 82% of those attempts, hinting that he has decent shooting touch … Has a great understanding of angles and seeks out contact on his drives, while usually being under control and not getting many offensive fouls…Plays with good energy and has been known to be a student of the game and solid leader … Would not be hard to see Cooper excel in a high octane offensive system that likes to get out an run, has a quiet flair and excitement to his style of play that could easily lead to him being a fan favorite …","Generously listed at 6’1 165, and without much of a frame, vertical athleticism or wingspan to play bigger and taller than he is, Cooper’s diminutive size is a hurdle that will ultimately limit his efficiency as a player at the next level … As stated, he was extremely effective getting into the paint whether with the help of a screen or using his quickness, but he was a subpar finisher amongst the trees once at the rim and struggled against some of the teams with NBA-sized frontline athletes (ie Kentucky and Baylor) … Saw a good amount of his shots around the hoop get blocked when he didn’t draw a foul; and without explosive leaping ability its hard to envision this improving with a step up against NBA competition, making the continued development of his in-between game paramount … While he is clearly a standout and high usage floor general, his turnovers need to be cut down some as well (4 TOPG, 18 per 100 possessions) and he sees a lot of his passes get deflected due to his size but also just occasionally getting ahead of himself forcing passes, whether due to confidence in his ability or pressing the issue because Auburn was struggling down the stretch … His shooting, both spotting up and working off the bounce, is a work in progress as well (22.8% on nearly 5 3PA/game); he has a hitched up, inconsistent form with little elevation and a noticeable backwards lean that led to some ugly misses and doesn’t project to be very effective against closeouts and contests from NBA players … Smaller guards usually have to be much more precise with everything in the NBA to overcome their lack of size, and the time it takes for him to step into his shots plays into bigger, more athletic defenders’ hands … Has OK natural shooting touch and sporadically made defenders pay for diving screens, but not nearly enough and teams will try make him prove he can hit jumpers to slow down the threat of his PnR game … Does not offer much defensively other than occasionally as a pest applying on-ball pressure, and will need to be “masked” often by a good defensive scheme or a bigger bodied back court mate to not be a liability on this end … Has the types of problems you’d associate with smaller guards on this end (can be posted up, washed out of plays by screens, shot over and posted up with ease, gets steamrolled to the basket by bigger ball handlers etc) … Also didn’t do himself favors with effort, fundamentals and defensive focus, as he struggled with containing simple dribble drives, off-ball awareness, getting back into plays after getting beat and sometimes fouling jump shooters as well … Pretty ball-dominant player, and though this is only a minor issue for a PG prospect, he is not likely to make an impact when he doesn’t have the ball and usually can been seen with his feet nailed to the 3 point line …",,Signed with an agent following the 2020-21 season effectively ending his college career … Projected as a late first to early second round pick for the 2021 NBA Draft … Turns 20 on June 11th …," Cooper’s Fr. season was highly anticipated after a decorated HS career in GA, especially after he had to sit out multiple games before the NCAA granted him eligibility … Came in and immediately was an impact player in the SEC, hitting the ground running by lighting up the scoreboard on a young Auburn team and showing why he was a ballyhooed recruit with his excellent floor general skills … He had to carry the load for a 13-12 Auburn team, and the results were there offensively as Cooper had his fingerprints on what was a high octane attack (83 ppg in Cooper’s 12 games) with the run-and-shoot style Coach Bruce Pearl prefers to play … His lack of size and some of the limitations that come with it, especially defensively, will likely polarize and make some teams paused on him, but he has some of the characteristics (anticipatory passing, basketball instincts and understanding of timing and angles as a finisher) of smaller players who overcame the odds and have gone on to have success as pros …",yes,-5.4,-0.297,-0.1,highly talented creative lead guard prospect excels playmaker ball hand

an any wing prospect in the 2012 class … Stands at 6’7 and weighs just under 230 lbs, and is put together very nicely, with his muscle being evenly placed throughout his upper and lower body … On top of being physically mature, Taylor is also a high-level athlete who is very fast for his size and a powerful leaper who likes to take off on 2 feet … Strong finisher who has highlight-reel caliber athleticism, but is much more likely to finish with a safe, and often powerful, 2-hand jam than he is to try a fancy dunk … Runs the floor extremely well, and can beat the entire defense down the floor for easy buckets at times … Taylor is best on offense when he can move without the ball to find open spots to get high percentage looks around the basket … Will make a big man pay if they aren’t aware of him on the weakside … You have to watch out for him on baseline slashes … Is effective on straight line slashes to the rim, where his quick step, strength, long strides and athleticism allow him to be effective on his way to the hoop … Improved his jump shot nicely in his 4 years at Vandy … Came to college with no 3 point range, and took steps forward in each of his seasons, being a 42% shooter from deep as a Sr. on more than 4 attempts a night … Also got better from mid-range as his career progressed … Has high-level potential on the defensive end, and his defense could be where his most value as a prospect lies … Is versatile on this end, and defended everything except C when at Vandy…Is very fundamentally sound and moves his feet very well … Has the size to defend SG’s and a lot of the bigger SF’s in time … Was arguably the best defending wing in the SEC last season, even though Kentucky’s Michael Kidd-Gilchrist got most of the pub … Always contests shots … Is great at knowing when to gamble for passing lane steals and when to just play solid defense against his man … Solid passer, who is unselfish and plays within the scheme … Doesn’t play outside of his role, and seems to be an unselfish teammate … Has some ability to post up due to playing extended time at the PF spot for Vandy, and isn’t bad in these instances with a basic jump hook … Rebounds pretty well on the wing on both ends, but particularly offensively … Improved very steadily over his career, developing everything from his jump shot to even his body … Could be better in an up-tempo style than at a slower pace like Vandy played … Extremely productive player for Vandy, who was on the All-SEC 1st Team as a Sr., and 2nd Team as a Soph. and Jr … Started every game except 1 during his Vandy career, a testament to his durability and value to the program …Incredible athlete … Great leaping ability, very smooth player … Excellent perimeter defender with quick feet and good lateral movement … Good instincts on defense … Great length and size (6’7"", 224), allow him to get a lot of steals + deflections … Great timing on both ends of the floor (i.e. blocks, alley oops, put backs) … Very good at drawing contact and getting to the line (7th in SEC in FTA) … Ability to get to the rim at will when he puts his head down and mind to it … Good form on jumper, even if inconsistent … Still appears to have untapped potential … Strong body with excellent shoulders and ability to play through contact … Competes well when he gets challenged …    Weaknesses: Tendency to disappear during games at some points or even for stretches of games …When doesn’t have ball in his hands, can become very passive and just watch at times … Inconsistent mid-range jumper but has good form … Lacks confidence in jumper allowing opposing defense to dare him into shooting by giving him space … No college three-point range, let alone NBA … Occasional tendency to go for flashy play when simple one would be best … Feel for the game is a little below average as he didn’t play against a high level of competition until his late teenage years … Perimeter skills, ball handling and passing are both in need of improvement … Despite high level athleticism is surprisingly better in half court than transition …","The biggest chink in Taylor’s arsenal is clearly his ball-handling ability … Struggles with change of direction dribbles, and was used in these instances a bit too much for Vandy which magnified it a bit more than it probably should’ve been … Shouldn’t be asked to take more than 2 or 3 dribbles offensively to be at his best … Very reliant on his strong (right) hand … Although Taylor is a great athlete, he is a bit mechanical with the ball in his hands … Even with his jump being a weapon for him his last 2 seasons, teams will want to see how he adjusts to the deeper NBA range and prove that he is respectable with his shot … Mediocre mid-range game … Has a history of disappearing from games at bad times and having shaky confidence and aggression … Physically gifted, but has a 6’6 wingspan and seemingly small hands at 6’7, which is subpar for his size and may make him play a hair smaller than he actually is … Doesn’t project to be more than a 4th option scorer at best whenever he’s on the floor …",,"Native of Norrkoping, Sweden.

A strong, determined competitor … Tremendous versatility and feel for the game … Creativity. Great vision and passing ability. A natural playmaker. Strong one on one skills. Adept at creating shots for himself and others … Strong shooting ability with a polished pull up jumper. Textbook form on his shot. Generates a nice rhythm on catch and shoot getting good elevation. Elbow extended. High release point. Consistent mechanics. Deep range … Consumate leader … Unselfish passer …. Seems to always be a step ahead of his competition. Great anticipation … Extremely confident … A tank. Strong frame and enjoys using his physicality to overpower opponents … Can take the ball into traffic and finish with contact … Explosive leaping off 2 feet … Shows a willingness to get after it on the defensive end. Takes pride in being a guy that can lock you down defensively. Quick hands lead to a lot of steals … Polished and advanced all around skills. Has a chance to be a difference maker the instant he steps on the floor for the Cowboys …","Not a great outside shooter.  Only made 29% from distance last season.  Needs to polish his mechanics and hit on a more consistent basis.  Struggles mightily on jumpers when guarded.  Release slowed by bringing the ball down to his knees before rising up and releasing.  Simply needs to be more consistent with his shot mechanics…Opponents will find it easier to stay in front of Smart because they don’t have to guard him as tight and respect his jumper…Not a very efficient scorer.  Needs to take smarter jump shots and not settle for pull-up threes…Could stand to be more patient and unselfish rather than forcing it and becoming dead-set on taking a shot at times…His assist/turnover ratio of 1.78 is not great.  Could certainly cut down on turnovers and be more patient on offense.  His aggression can sometimes be a weakness.  It also leads to offensive fouls on occasion…Mediocre ballhandler, another source of his turnover problems…Uses his physical gifts well, but ultimately doesn’t have great athleticism…Free throw percentage dropped from 78% to 73% between his freshman and sophomore seasons…Interestingly enough, Smart’s knack for making winning plays did not generally carry over to crunch time.  In 7 Cowboys games that Smart played in this season that were decided by 3 or fewer points or in overtime, Smart shot a mere 3/14 (21%) from the field in the final two minutes and overtime of those games.  He also missed several free throws in that span…Can be a bit of a ""flopper""…Smart’s teams have lost in their first game in the NCAA Tournament in each of the past two years, despite being expected to win both times.  The Cowboys also went on a big-time skid to end the Big 12 regular season, due, in part, to Smart’s suspension and inability to right the ship as the team point guard and star player…NBA scouts will have the Texas Tech incident fresh in their minds, when Smart lost his cool and shoved a fan, earning him a three-game suspension.  Smart doesn’t always maintain his composure, which can force him to make bad decisions both in and out of gameplay, and doesn’t always have a grey attitude or body language on the court.  This incident could have scared away a few teams at the top of the draft…Solid athlete, but not spectacular. Not the quickest or most explosive guard … Not likely to finish above the rim in traffic, but utilizes his athleticism well … Uses hustle, brains and will power over sheer athletic prowess … Lateral speed isn’t the best … Doesn’t have a precise fit at either guard position. Undersized at the 2 and not a pure PG. A combo guard in every sense … Can be a little too ball dominant at times. But that comes with the territory in high school when you’re the star player … Needs to learn how to run off of screens and play off the ball a little better, for times when he’s asked to play the 2 position …",,Second-team All-American his freshman season…Pre-season All-American prior to this season…All-Big 12 as a sophomore…Developed a reputation in high school for being one of the strongest competitors and top guard prospects …," Smart is an excellent combination of strength, size, length, instinct, and competitiveness that will not be found in any other player in this draft.  His shooting stroke is subpar and his intensity can sometimes get the best of him, but Smart has a good chance at being a top-6 pick in this draft, holding his own with this year’s crop of super-freshmen and Aussie phenom Dante Exum…  Jacob Stallard 5/10/14",yes,12.4,0.092,7.7,strong heady point guard great size instinctsuses mixture quickness strength instinct aggressiveness get rim us big frame

Shows very good leadership and maturity, and figures to make an excellent teammate at the next level …","Though a standout athlete with nice size, Toppin doesn’t seem to possess great foot quickness,

… Perhaps his rebounding can improve with focus on core strength, and work on fundamentals  … Though he’s been solid on defense in college, he does not project to be much of a shot blocker or threat in the passing lanes at the NBA level, giving him a unspectacular ceiling on that end of the floor … Doesn’t have many moves, as a low post player he prefers to almost exclusively use right handed jump hooks when he can’t simply dunk the ball, and he hasn’t showed much off the bounce when facing up either … Not much a shot creator … Turned 22 in March making him older than the average lottery

player with an intriguing combination of a good shooting stroke and above the rim athletic ability …He’s currently not much off the dribble, is a surprisingly mediocre rebounder and his lateral quickness is somewhat questionable for a 4 man, but he is a hard-working, efficient player who has more strengths than weaknesses and figures to be among the first players to come off the board on draft night … Has made it known that he would love to join the Golden State Warriors who go into the lottery with the best chance of landing the top pick and at worst will be drafting fifth … Figures

A right-handed player who seems to favor going left … Good rhythm shooter with a high release that he uses to shoot over smaller players well, and has 3-point range that is still developing consistency … Occasionally showed flashes of being able to hit shots from deep off the dribble too … Was an 82% FT shooter as a Fr., illustrating solid shooting touch … A willing defender, had some success on that end as a Fr. in a tough, veteran league like the Big 10 … Had 4 games with multiples blocked shots as a Fr., which is good for a guard prospect…Has earned praise for being very coachable in HS, AAU and in his lone collegiate season at Michigan State … Still very early in his development stages and would be a teenager through about half of the NBA season schedule as a rookie …6’6 scoring guard … Good size and length for position … Good form on jump shot with no wasted motion. Shoots well from midrange and 3PT. Shoots well off the catch or pulling up off the dribble. Shot 37.1% 3PT% on 5.8 attempts per game at the U16 Americas Championship in 2019 … Good touch on runner/floater and midrange scoring ability … Good free throw shooter.

Can work on getting to the rim more and doesn’t show much slashing ability, tends to settle for contested midrange pull-ups at times. Doesn’t show much creativity with the ball or ability to break down the defense off the dribble … Unfortunately, he didn’t get a chance to show improvement with 2020 summer grassroot events cancelled but he didn’t shoot efficient in 2019 at 36.3% FG% over the Under Armour Association and 37.5% FG% at the U16 Americas Championship … Unselfish and solid moving the ball but doesn’t show advanced playmaking ability.

… Christie played more of an off-ball role than he did previously in HS but he still showed the ability to help out teammates as a high IQ cutter and as a slasher with the ball … His mid-range game looked promising and he held his own defensively as a Fr. in a physically demanding, veteran Big 10 … Still, every area of his game could use more refinement and he needs to improve his physical strength to see other parts of his game rise (ie FT attempts, finishing through contact, dealing with the stronger build wings he’ll see at the pro level)…His shot selection and consistency will also need to develop, as well as his court vision and timing as a passer … All things considered he had an unspectacular Fr season, but he is still very young and there are some teams that will have

State, but he is capable of creating space, surveying the floor and passing the ball with either hand out of pick and roll situations … With better talent around him in the NBA, he will look like an even better playmaker … His open court speed makes him particularly dangerous in transition, as he will collapse the defense and find cutters or open shooters on the perimeter … He does not need a screen to collapse the defense … Instead he can usually break his man down off the dribble and get in the paint to kick out to open teammates … He also shows flashes of impressive vision and accuracy off the pick and roll … He will have a chance to be an absolute force on both ends of the court in the NBA … Has excellent size at the point guard position at 6’2 with a 6’5 wingspan … Shows a lot of confidence in his abilities and has a swagger on the floor, should not have any trouble adjusting to playing at the NBA level and be a standout PG at the next level … His upside is among the best of any player in this draft …Explosive point guard with size and great intangibles for the position … Elite level athlete and plays well above the rim.

Tends to hesitate when shooting off the catch … Only shot 22.5% from three over the adidas Gauntlet … Has shooting range out to the three, though still needs consistency … Can become more dedicated on the defensive end … Doesn’t always get in a low stance. Tends to gamble a bit … Shows a floater when he beats the first line of defense but overall can improve his overall midrange game … Tends to go through the motions at times, can be too nonchalant … Doesn’t move much off the ball. Can improve in the half court … Knee injury raises questions where his immense athleticism makes him injury prone. To his credit he has relentlessly attacked his rehab and strengthening his legs and body …","Smith enters his freshman season at NC State.

run-jump athleticism…Looks the part, is 6’9 and has a great frame to possibly add as much as 10-15 lbs without losing his athleticism … Shows real good explosiveness as a leaper, able to elevate suddenly when stationary … Good length, an added bonus to his leaping ability … Can finish with authority around the basket, and will get his fair share of dunks … Looks good in the pick and roll game especially, and is capable of finishing inside … Pretty active and plays with good energy … Looks more and more comfortable facing up and making mid-range shots, able to hit shots most consistently from 15-17 ft … Effective with basic post moves that allows him to utilize his length and athleticism, namely his right hand jump hook and drop-step …Shows good hands … Physical, willing to get wide and set screens that allow guards plenty of room to slash and kick out to him for jumpers or finishes around the rim … A late bloomer, added new wrinkles to his game every season at Baylor and is still polishing some of his more promising skills … Pretty good at moving around the paint to find ways to get easy shots … Good rebounding skills, shows good activity level and always boxes out when shots go up … Effective shot-blocker …Great combination of athleticism and length…Extremely efficient offensive player (61% on FGs last season)…Has a tremendous wingspan, making him a disruptive defensive presence and a good rebounder…Has a consistent mid-range jumper…Moves well without the ball…Is perfecting the turnaround jumper to expand his post game…Runs the floor well for a big man….Has bulked up over the past few years making him capable of playing in the post…His pogo stick athleticism makes him an excellent alley-lop target…Gets a lot of putbacks on offense…Has all the tools to be a great shot blocker and averaged 1.9 BPG last season…Commits very few turnovers…Jefferson is gifted with several natural tools, giving him a lot of upside as a pro player…","Needs to continue to add polish to his offensive game, not the most skilled player and can struggle when things aren’t kept simple for him … Doesn’t look to do much with his left hand, and can be a fairly easy matchup at times because he offers little variations of moves on the low post … Though he developed his jump shot nicely in college, he can’t be considered a consistent shooter yet … Expanded his range to the college 3 as a Sr., but isn’t going to be much (if at all) of a threat from that range in the NBA … Can be noted that he fell in love with his jumper too much last year, and got away from his strengths as a finisher a bit more often than necessary … Has some strength and added some weight throughout college, but still needs to improve his frame more (only 218 lbs) and desperately needs to get stronger in his lower body … Not a very good defensive player, and can be overpowered by bigger PF’s … Not a try-hard defender or the most aware defender, which is a shame considering his potential on that end and how active he is on offense … Mostly a straight-line player, doesn’t have the necessary ball-handling skills to take bigger guys off the dribble and shows a bit of stiffness laterally … Will be 24 at the early part of next NBA season, and his true upside is fairly limited after being a 5 year player at Baylor …Still raw as a scorer and a rebounder.  Relies on his physical tools too heavily sometimes…Needs to diversify his post game…Has a narrow frame which makes it harder for him to gain position in the post…At age 22, the clock is ticking for him to reach his full potential…Lacks muscle compared to other big men…Not much of a passer.  Averaged 0.3 APG last season…Needs to learn to box out more effectively…",,," Jefferson’s athleticism and physical profile are going to be his main calling cards to an NBA career … He has proven to be an emphatic finisher who improved his skill level pretty well throughout his time at Baylor, and he adds active rebounding as well … He still needs improvement in some areas, and his post game is a work in progress, also his age is a concern too … The 6’9 Jefferson does have some distinct value as a PF though, and is a prospect to watch even if he isn’t selected in the draft … He could hear his name in the 2nd round of the 2014 draft as a best case scenario …Jorrye Nixon 5/30/14",yes,13.2,0.071,-0.2,jefferson wiry

Shot 78.4% FT% at the U16 European Championship A in 2017 … Leads in transition and in the half-court. Plays under control, good balance of playing aggressive without forcing his impact.

Finished second in assists with six per game over the Under Armour Association and the second best assist/turnover with 2.8 in the league in 2018. Finished sixth in assists with four per game at the U16 European Championship A in 2017 … Competes on the defensive end. Averaged 1.5 steals per game over the Under Armour Association in 2018. Led the U16 European Championship A with three steals per game in 2017 … Draws fouls at a good rate … Unselfish. Leader on the floor, plays with competitiveness and passion …","Though on the surface Mannion’s prospect checklist is pretty impressive, he Is not always the sum of his parts … While he is a pretty good playmaker and generally shows a relatively high basketball IQ for a young lead guard, he will sometimes bail out the defense by taking difficult shots or playing hero ball when he should just be patient and make an extra pass or set up the half-court offense … He still has some maturing to do as a point guard and decision maker … His shot looks nice, but the results become more inconsistent the further away from the basket he is, and he struggled with his efficiency all season as a Fr … Shot selection needs improvement, but Mannion also needs more repetition in practice as a set shooter, as there is no doubt he has the ability to and would benefit from being able to knock down open shots with more consistency after being streaky at Arizona … Though he likes to work the mid-range, his favorite shots are usually low percentage floaters and runners, and he really struggles to both get all the way to the rim or finish with much effectiveness against taller athletes…Is not more than an adequate athlete by NBA standards, wont blow anyone away with his speed or explosiveness … Doesn’t project to be a plus defender in the NBA with his middling physical skills, effort and athleticism and may also struggle to defend most SGs at the NBA level after having a hard time trying to defend bigger guards in college when he had to … Struggled to live up to his abilities as an outside shooter, connecting on just 32% of his three pointers in his freshman season …Doesn’t have great size and length with a 6’2.5 wingspan and 8’1.5 standing reach … Smooth athlete but isn’t incredibly explosive, especially when comparing him to other top guards of his class. Nice first step and change of speed but lacks elite quickness, hindering him as a perimeter defender … His lack of size and athleticism can limit him as a creator and finisher, may have to be more

In only 21 minutes per game, he’s leading the Big 12 in blocked shots (2.7 per game) and has emerged as a terror on the help side. He shows excellent timing and instincts to block shots, and gets off the ground quickly despite his lack of great fluidity … Also, with a reported 9’1.5"" standing reach, he has the length to contest shots 1 on 1 at the NCAA and NBA level, and while his current weight isn’t conducive to pushing around NBA big men, 240 pounds is considerably larger than many young forwards have come into the league at since the 1 and done rule was implemented … Turner even shows surprising passing and decision making with a 1:1 a/to ratio, unusual for a freshman big … Scores very highly in the character and communication department. Seems wise beyond his years and should have no trouble adapting to the NBA game and staying focused …   Weaknesses: Lacks fluidity, certainly he’s a guy who is mobile and can run the court, but his athleticism isn’t something that jumps out when you watch him … He has had some difficulties with his hips related to growth. His legs appear to be extremely stiff to the point where it appears he runs with a slight limp. Time will tell whether this is a temporary thing or he will always be a player lacking fluidity … Since he is so young, he could be one of those players who could improve his athletic ability, and flexibility with continued weight training … His lower body strength is probably of the most concern right now, as he can be pushed off the block and out of position by older, more physical NCAA players … While he’s definitely held his own in some bigger games this year, when matched against players his own size or larger from a bulk standpoint, he’s yet to really excel. In 5 games against major conference opponents, Myles has averaged 6.4 points, 6 rebounds, and 2 blocks per game which is big drop off when compared to 14.75 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.1 blocks per game against smaller mid major schools … There’s a lot to like about Turner, but his stats will need to be a little more reliable as he enters Big 12 play and doesn’t have the luxury of beating up on smaller schools who can’t match his size …"," Lacks fluidity, certainly he’s a guy who is mobile and can run the court, but his athleticism isn’t something that jumps out when you watch him … He has had some difficulties with his hips related to growth.

202682,Derrick Williams,2011,1,2,2,Draft,1610612750,Minnesota,Timberwolves,MIN,Arizona,College/University,1,Derrick,Williams,,,83.0,David West/Michael Beasley,"Williams’ production in his 2 years at Arizona were phenomenal, as he managed to improve on his excellent Fr. stats across the board … In terms of physical tools, Williams has very good size for a combo forward, boasting a very strong 6’9 248 lb frame with a long 7’1 wingspan added for good measure … Very fluid and smooth athlete, who also flashes explosiveness leaping off of 2 feet … A true matchup problem for defenders, Williams uses his strong footwork and soft touch to score the ball with very good effectiveness in the post or facing up … His shooting ability is good, as evidenced by his 57% 3-point percentage (albeit on a limited 2 attempts a night), and he uses it to keep his matchup honest so they can’t play off of him … Also functional from mid-range, as a threat to slash or shoot … One of the best isolation players in the entire draft, as PF’s have big trouble with his rangy first step and body control for a guy his size, and SFs are generally at a disadvantage in terms of their size and strength … Has an ease at which he creates shots from the PF spot that will continue to make him a big threat from that position, and his size is certainly adequate enough to play down low too … Fairly decisive finisher down low, who uses his wide lower body to seal in good position to get the pass and go up with shots before the defense collapses on him … Works hard moving without the ball, and isn’t indifferent to throwing his body in his man down low to establish very deep position … Although he’s not likely to seal NBA PF’s as much as he did in college, he also can post from mid-range and utilize quick spins and turnaround moves to use his dribble drive game to his advantage … Understands how to shield defenders using his body off the dribble … Strong finisher, who will at times slip free of the D around the rim and make emphatic dunks as a 2 footed leaper … Very capable finisher with both hands … Pretty easy shooting stroke with a soft touch and compact fundamentals that are very consistent … Pretty good offensive rebounder due to his quick 2nd bounce and solid motor, and will get high percentage shots every game due to this … Won’t take very many bad shots, which is a great sign due to the go-to role he embraced for 2 years … Got to the foul line a lot due to his ability to be a mismatch, shot an OK percentage (74%) once there, and this aspect of his game will very likely translate to the NBA as well … Super efficient, and scored 19.5 ppg on just 10 FG attempts a game … Ability to develop from a fairly unheralded recruit, to a surprisingly productive Fr., then to improve on a great Fr. season across the board as a Soph. speaks to his work ethic, and he still can make improvements on his weaknesses right now to continue to grow … Showed the ability to step up in big situations with kep plays to win games …Williams had an excellent freshman season, averaging 15 and 7 for a rebounding Arizona team … A long, 6’9 forward, Williams possesses sound footwork and fundamentals when dealing in the paint… He absorbs contact well, and gets to the line at an excellent rate, attempting 7.5 attempts per game… One of his best assets revolves around his high offensive awareness level- he times his cuts in the paint in rhythm with his point guard and the ball movement around him … He uses pump fakes and positions his body efficiently when going up for a layup or dunk under the rim … With his back to the basket, Williams uses his strength, along with long and efficient drop steps to create separation where he can score on 10 foot turn around jumpers and touch hooks … He is capable of facing up, where he can attack by putting the ball on the floor, and though he doesn’t have the speed or handle to blow by his defender, he uses his body to shield his defender, making it difficult to contest his shot … Defensively, he does a good job bodying up and defending the post … Only averaged 2.5 personal fouls per game illustrates his high defensive IQ and understanding of defensive positioning … 7-plus foot wingspan also helps him on the boards and blocking shots …","Considered a combo forward, and there are some questions about what position he will defend with the most effectiveness … Insists that he sees himself as a SF more than a PF, but he has never really played SF dating back to HS, and would certainly be a shaky defender against NBA SF’s … Hard to see him being as efficient and effective if he plays more SF than PF, although he certainly will be able to play some legit time on the wing … Was a pretty modest defensive player in college, as his lateral quickness is mediocre and his length is just OK, which are respective problems for the SF and PF positions … Definitely has wavering intensity on this end, and will allow baskets without much resistance around the rim, particularly against the bigger, more athletic PF’s he faced … Wasn’t that great a defensive rebounder (5.5 a game) and will ball-watch, and gives up rebounds on the defensive end that give offenses 2nd chance opportunities at times … Although he generally is decisive, Williams struggles at times with defenders crowding him and is pretty turnover prone when he gets collapsed upon … Doesn’t look to pass the ball very much … Saw limited minutes at times in games due to foul trouble … Won’t be a big threat in the passing lanes or blocking shots at the NBA level …Williams is slightly undersized for a power forward at the next level, lacking great bulk … He will likely always use speed and length to compensate for a lack of brute strength … He would really benefit from developing a consistent mid range jump shot … His face up game would be more effective, and it would add another dimension to his offensive repertoire … At times, takes him a little too long to execute his move and get off his shot … Needs to improve vision in the post – when the ball goes down low to him it rarely gets kicked out … Goes through cold spells from the FT line. Must become more consistent …",,," Was the catalist in knocking off the defending champion Duke Blue Devils with his tremendous performance in the 2011 NCAA tourney … Williams’ blend of size and his pure talent scoring the ball on offense will make him a viable option in the NBA. His ability to be a matchup problem at the NBA level offensively will make him a coveted prospect in this draft, as today’s NBA covets mismatch PF’s who can score at Williams’ level. He’s not a great rebounder and he’s not a very good defender, but he does have the body to hit the glass with solid effectiveness and his fundamentals on D aren’t bad. Williams will go on to have a productive NBA career, particularly offensively.Jorrye Nixon 6/17/11",yes,13.4,0.076,0.8,williams production 2 year arizona phenomenal managed improve excellent fr stats across board term physical tool williams good size combo forward boasting strong 69 248 lb frame long 71 wingspan added good measure fluid smooth athlete also flash explosiveness leaping 2 foot true matchup problem defender williams us strong footwork soft touch score ball good effectiveness post facing shooting ability good evidenced 57 3point percentage albeit limited 2 attempt night us keep matchup honest cant play also functional midrange threat slash shoot one best isolation player entire draft pfs big trouble rangy first step body control guy size sfs generally disadvantage term size strength ease creates shot pf spot continue make big threat position size certainly adequate enough play low fairly decisive finisher low us wide lower body seal good position get pas go shot defense collapse work hard moving without ball isnt indifferent throwing body man low establish deep position although he likely seal nba pfs much college also post midrange utilize quick spin turnaround move use dribble drive game advantage understands shield defender using body dribble strong finisher time slip free around rim make emphatic dunk 2 footed leaper capable finisher hand pretty easy shooting stroke soft touch compact fundamental consistent pretty good offensive rebounder due quick 2nd bounce solid motor get high percentage shot every game due wont take many bad shot great sign due goto role embraced 2 year got foul line lot due ability mismatch shot ok percentage 74 aspect game likely translate nba well super efficient scored 195 ppg 10 fg attempt game ability develop fairly unheralded recruit surprisingly productive fr improve great fr season across board soph speaks work ethic still make improvement weakness right continue grow showed ability step big situation kep play win game williams excellent freshman season averaging 15 7 rebounding arizona team long 69 forward williams posse sound footwork fundamental dealing paint absorbs contact well get line excellent rate attempting 75 attempt per game one best asset revolves around high offensive awareness level time cut paint rhythm point guard ball movement around us pump fake position body efficiently going layup dunk rim back basket williams us strength along long efficient drop step create separation score 10 foot turn around jumper touch hook capable facing attack putting ball floor though doesnt speed handle blow defender us body shield defender making difficult contest shot defensively good job bodying defending post averaged 25 personal foul per game illustrates high defensive iq understanding defensive positioning 7plus foot wingspan also help board blocking shot,considered combo forward question position defend effectiveness insists see sf pf never really played sf dating back h would certainly shaky defender nba sfs hard see efficient effective play sf pf although certainly able play legit time wing pretty modest defensive player college lateral quickness mediocre length ok respective problem sf pf position definitely wavering intensity end allow basket without much resistance around rim particularly bigger athletic pfs faced wasnt great defensive rebounder 55 game ballwatch give rebound defensive end give offense 2nd chance opportunity time although generally decisive williams struggle time defender crowding pretty turnover prone get collapsed upon doesnt look pas ball much saw limited minute time game due foul trouble wont big threat passing lane blocking shot nba level williams slightly undersized power forward next level lacking great bulk likely always use speed length compensate lack brute strength would really benefit developing consistent mid range jump shot face game would effective would add another dimension offensive repertoire time take little long execute move get shot need improve vision post ball go low rarely get kicked go cold spell ft line must become consistent,,33.21726618,1.05,34.87812949,0.382478462,N,Y,Y,N,0.9805,1

203087,Jeremy Lamb,2012,1,12,12,Draft,1610612745,Houston,Rockets,HOU,Connecticut,College/University,1,Jeremy,Lamb,,,97.0,Reggie Miller,"Long and lanky swingman with a nice athletic profile and a good skill-set for the off-guard position … Good size … Stands just over 6’5"" in shoes with a 6’11"" wingspan, which gives him great length for the shooting guard position in the NBA … Great leaping ability … Gets off the floor quickly … Has good explosiveness … Nice quickness, and moves well with or without the ball … Excellent all-around jump-shooter … Spots up well off the ball … Able to shoot comfortably in motion, from either mid-range or on the perimeter … Should be a very dangerous weapon in an NBA motion offense as somebody that can score consistently off of curls and v-cuts … Can also shoot off the dribble … Has a nice step-back move that creates a fair amount of separation … Due to his length and athleticism, has a high release on his jump shot that is difficult to defend … Has range out to the NBA three-point line … Good ball-handling skills that still have the potential to get better … Has shown the ability to break down defenders off the dribble, especially when driving to his left … Possesses a nice looking runner that he doesn’t use often, but could turn into an important skill down the road … Solid defender with a fair amount of potential left in this area … Good lateral quickness and length makes him difficult to beat off the dribble … Has been a clutch performer in the past, especially during UConn’s national title run in 2011 … A prospect that should be able to produce right away as somebody that excels playing off the ball, but also has the potential to become better at creating for himself …   Weaknesses: Very thin at this point … Added strength should help him finishing through contact in the future … Doesn’t shoot a lot of free-throws (3.6 attempts in 37.2 minutes per game) which is a real shame as he has the athleticism to get to the rim a lot and the touch to convert a high percentage of attempts from the stripe … Still limited when creating offense for himself … Most of the turnovers he commits occur due to his inexperience handling the ball … Strongly favors driving left and is extremely mistake prone when driving right … Three-point percentage dipped from 36.8% in 2010-2011 to 33.6% in 2011-2012, likely due to the extra attention teams could give him with Kemba Walker having left the team for the NBA … Effort level is inconsistent defensively …   Overall: Lamb is a nice combination of production and potential, with all the tools needed to become a great all-around starting shooting guard in the NBA … Most of his weaknesses are showing improvement and could be polished over the next few years with added experience and a good coaching staff … With everything Lamb offers, he’s unlikely to slip out of the lottery on draft night …Lamb is a thin 6’5 wing with a monster wingspan (around 7’1) … A good athlete with nice fluidity and quickness, and solid explosiveness and leaping skills … Runs the floor very well … Plays with great composure and proved to be extremely clutch in UConn’s run through the NCAA tournament … Shows a very promising game off the dribble, and is able to stick pull-up jumpers pretty well right now … Pretty good ball-handling skills … Rangy strider and quick 1st step allows him to get a step on defenders pretty well … Likes to use floaters in the lane, and will use to the glass to bank shots in … Capable spot-up jump shooter with consistent range out to the college 3-point line, and has the ability to make shots off screens and curls too … Will move without the ball … Lamb proved to be a very good defender last season for UConn, and that’s really promising considering he was a Fr. on a nat’l title team and in a competitive league like the Big East … He was able to defend all 3 perimeter positions effectively with his length and quickness , which is intriguing considering his youth … Length and quick hands proved him to be a threat as a ball-thief, and it created transition opportunities for himself and teammates …Willing rebounder … Generally shows a high basketball IQ and has a lot of the traits of a former player’s son (his dad, Rolando Lamb, was an NBA draft pick) … Reportedly has a strong work ethic, which will be needed for him to reach his potential …","The most noticeable chink in Mr. Lamb’s arsenal revolves around his lack of bulk and strength … Lamb is very thin and he has the narrow shoulders that will make adding significant weight harder than usual … His lack of girth and strength shows in certain aspects of his game too, mainly around the rim offensively and as a off-ball defender … Got to the free throw line at an abysmal rate, due to a lack of confidence in his strength, and settled for pull-ups and floaters much more often than he chose to challenge players who protected the rim in half-court situations … Lamb generally struggled finishing around the rim against contact, despite having more than adequate length and athleticism to do so … On D, Lamb’s lack of strength showed when getting through screens … He has enough length to contest even when screens set up what appears to be a clean look for his matchup against college teams, but with bigger guys setting those screens in the NBA, he will likely have to adjust … He was promising on D for UConn last year he will have to get stronger to defend NBA guards consistently … Although Lamb is a pretty good ball-handler, he doesn’t have the moves to shake free of the best defenses off the dribble consistently yet … Can be inconsistent with his jump shot, particularly off the dribble …",,," Lamb is a nice combination of production and potential, with all the tools needed to become a great all-around starting shooting guard in the NBA … Most of his weaknesses are showing improvement and could be polished over the next few years with

His combination of length and fluidity/athleticism makes him an extremely intriguing prospect … Quick reflexes … He even shows some touch around the basket and a decent offensive feel. While not much of an outside threat, his midrange game shows some ability and potential to develop … He’s best at scoring on garbage baskets and can get out on the break and finish … Seems to understand what he does well offensively and stays ""within himself"" … Solid rebounder. Goes after the ball on both ends and although his positioning could improve, he’s got natural rebounding abilities … Quick feet. From Brazil, and his footwork is excellent, a ""futball"" upbringing has given him excellent foot dexterity. Able to slide his feet laterally better than the average 7-footer … Solid hands. A 60% free throw shooter, which is not great but good for his age and position and should improve … As the 2012-13 season has progressed, his defense has shown some improvement.An athletic specimen … Shows tremendous length and great balance … Runs the floor like a deer, makes quick moves. Can change directions quickly. Very springy … A big time shot blocker using his length and leaping ability to be an eraser around the basket … Excellent on the break where he uses his tremendous fluidity and speed to convert dunks … Shows some offensive ability with a solid shooting touch and ability to knock down free throws … Tremendous rebounder. Shows good hands.","Nogueira must become more intense defensively … Has a lot of defensive potential because of his size, but at this point he’s a huge defensive liability and would not see the court in the NBA because of it … Lacks basic fundamentals on the defensive end and either has not received basic coaching instructions, or is difficult to coach. His lack of strength, confidence and focus on defense is a glaring hole to his game … Needs to just relax and be more patient instead of trying to ""make plays"", his length alone should make him an imposing opponent but he routinely takes himself out of plays biting on fakes as well as getting overpowered … He does not appear inspired to play defense and has no idea how to use his length to his advantage by staying patient, on balance and just reacting to plays … His lack of strength is another major concern as he has a slight frame and gets pushed off the block easily … His feel for the game is still a work in progress … He doesn’t seem to understand what he’s capable of and forgets that he’s so much bigger and more athletic than nearly everyone he faces … Could learn to be a shot blocker over time … His body lacks strength but it appears that he could add enough muscle to at least hold his position in the post … He’s a 1992 kid, so at just 20, it’s important to remember that bigs take the longest to fill into their bodies and develop … Toughness, intensity and passion for the game have been knocks on him. He seems to be maturing mentally and physically the past couple of seasons …The big knock against Lucas ""Bebe"" is that he is lazy … Sources around the team claim that he is a little bit difficult to deal with and already has a star’s attitude … Nothing can derail a promising career faster than a kid not willing to put the work in, so for Lucas, keeping his head on straight, continuing to work hard and focusing on his development is crucial if he’s going to realize his vast potential … Must continue to develop his upper body and overall strength … Still extremely skinny. 200 lbs. Must bulk up, but shows wiry strength and should be able to add weight successfully without diminishing his agility … Needs to keep developing his offensive game, prove himself against a high level of competition …",,"Nicknamed ""Bebe"", unfortunately at this point his game is as soft as a baby … If not for such a disappointing showing at the 2011 Treviso adidas Eurocamp in front of the entire International scouting contingent, he would likely be looked at as a lock first rounder and possibly even a lottery talent … With his combination of length, fluidity and age, plus the added allure of being an international player, he appears to be the ideal late first round ""project"" that a team like San Antonio/OKC would target to stash overseas for a few seasons …Nickname is ""Bebe"" which translates to ""baby"" … Also known as Lucas Riva … Full Name is Lucas Riva Amarante Nogueira… Plays for Estudiantes in Spain.

Adams often back cuts behind his defender for an easy layup … Despite being a scorer, Adams doesn’t dislike passing the ball, finishing the season with more than two assists per game … Perhaps the most effective part of his game is his mid-range game which is reminiscent of Rip Hamilton (though much different body type) … Adams does a great job in reading his defender on screens for jump shots (Alford work with him on reading screens certainly helped him improve this part of his game) and is great in using his strong upper body to put his defender ""in jail"" to finish with floaters or around the rim, though he is not exactly an top athlete … He also has really good post moves for a guard, often taking advantage of smaller guards to score or get fouled …","As noted Adams isn’t a great athlete. He doesn’t necessarily needs to be a great athlete to succeed in the League, but it will for sure make his life harder when he will have to score in the paint … I’m not sure that he can finish so easily over NBA bigs, he will have to take his mid-range game to an even higher level … And it will make his life a lot harder on the defensive end where he will have to show the ability to stay in front of his opponents … His lateral speed and foot speed aren’t where a NBA coach would like to have it but the strength of his upper body could help to handle the contact … The other knock on his game is how inconsistent he is as a 3pts shooter and particularly on close out situations … According to synergy in those situations when the defender is recovering on him he tends to shoot 81% of the time with very low percentages: 28%, well below average for a guard and clearly not the numbers you would expect from a player like him … He needs to become a much more consistent shooter or decision maker on close outs to be successful in the NBA, where particularly initially he will have to take advantage of those opportunities to show his value before having screens and plays run for him …",,"The prototype of a pure scorer, Jordan Adams didn’t waste time to impose himself as one of the best shot makers in the country … In two years at UCLA on a good or a bad night you could always count on Jordan Adams delivering 15 points … In addition to his ability to score, Jordan is able to bring to the table a desire for winning that led him to grab more than 5 rebounds per game and more than 2 steals per game (top ten in the country above well known great defenders like Aaron Craft) … It is no coincidence that some of the worst games that UCLA had this year, like losses to Duke, Stanford and Washington State happened when Adams had his worst games …",,yes,13.1,0.07,0.2,greatest attribute scoring ability competitiveness player really want win sell team many scorer use defensive end 35 second rest time dont crash board hard adam instead seek opportunity score time defense great anticipating passing lane jumping get fast break always sprint offensive half court find easy point offense crash paint using big body finish around rim also master cut exploiting teammate anderson ability create dribble adam often back cut behind defender easy layup despite scorer adam doesnt dislike passing ball finishing season two assist per game perhaps effective part game midrange game reminiscent rip hamilton though much different body type adam great job reading defender screen jump shot alford work reading screen certainly helped improve part game great using strong upper body put defender jail finish floater around rim though exactly top athlete also really good post move guard often taking advantage smaller guard score get fouled,noted adam isnt great athlete doesnt necessarily need great athlete succeed league sure make life harder score paint im sure finish easily nba bigs take midrange game even higher level make life lot harder defensive end show ability stay front opponent lateral speed foot speed arent nba coach would like strength upper body could help handle contact knock game inconsistent 3pts shooter particularly close situation according synergy situation defender recovering tends shoot 81 time low percentage 28 well average guard clearly number would expect player like need become much consistent shooter decision maker close out successful nba particularly initially take advantage opportunity show value screen play run,,12.4875,2.05,25.599375,0.322134385,Y,Y,Y,N,0.981,1

with a high level of versatility … Does a lot of positive things on the offensive and defensive ends well … Fundamentally sound … A threat to score from the inside and outside … Very good at attacking defenses on the drive … Solid first step, and finishes with good explosiveness … Improving as a mid-range and 3-point shooter … Has good range on his shot … Best as a spot up shooter (can lead to him being a floor spacer) … Can score effectively in the paint against smaller defenders … Able to create offense from mid-post (too quick for most PFs) … Has a strong face up game (can either attack the basket of hit face up jumpers) … Uses his size advantage and strength well while in the post, with great footwork and touch around the basket … Overall, he’s a good and crafty finisher at the rim … Very good at catching the ball on the wing, sweeping through and attacking the basket … Able to play above the rim … Has good hang time when in the air, allowing him to draw fouls or score … Explodes to the rim with power and speed off back door cuts & lob passes in transition … Moves well without the ball and is constantly in motion … Has shown slashing prowess … Not the type of player who needs the ball in his hands or have plays run for him to be effective … Runs the floor well and displays fluid movement … Correctly fills the lanes while running the fastbreak … Can handle the ball in transition … Can defend more than one position thanks to his athleticism and size … Crashes the offensive and defensive glass … Cuts from the perimeter for put backs … Great leaping ability paired with an effective box out technique … Stays active around the boards and has good anticipation … Rebounds long misses well … Not afraid to get physical, make hustle plays on both ends of the floor and put his body on the line … Good perimeter defender (lateral movement has improved and moves his feet well from side to side)… Knows how to effectively switch on ball screens as a defender on the perimeter … Stays on his man and contests shots … Good team defender … Plays hard and has a high basketball IQ … Unselfish player who looks for teammates often … Excellent at setting screens … Makes the extra pass and sees the floor well in the halfcourt and in transition … Rarely turns the ball over … Unselfish, high level teammate who plays with a lot of drive and exuberance for the game …A smooth, well rounded swingman, Sam Dekker has shown the ability to both stretch defenses, as well as put the ball on the floor and get to the rim … He shot a very impressive .391% from 3 point range as a freshman, but saw a bit of a dip as a sophomore (.326%) … Measures in at 6’9’’ in shoes and tips the scales at 229 pounds, giving he very good size for an NBA small forward … A very strong finisher at the rim (69.9% in 2013-14) Dekker has the athletic tools and size to dunk through contact and the coordination to make in air adjustments … Very good at moving without the ball has shown advanced understanding in weaving his way through screens to get open, utilizing backdoor cuts and also at breaking out for a transition dunk … Also a solid post game allows him to take advantage of mismatches … Pretty solid rebounder at 6.1 per game and 8.18 per 40 minutes … Extremely low mistake player … Only averaged 1.1 turnovers, and 1.4 fouls in just under 30 minutes per game … A very good system player, who understands the game, and has a versatile enough skill set to do a lot of different things to help his team win.","Good athlete, but not elite … Short arms for his size and a lack of extension (6-10 wingspan) … Needs to develop more consistency on his jump shot … Good but not great shooter … Not comfortable shooting the ball off the dribble (struggles to get his shot up) … He often hesitates or takes an extra dribble before shooting … Settles for errant jump shots … Needs to develop a smoother release (releases the ball with too much force/shoots with a fling) … Currently shoots 33 percent from the 3-point line … Lacks a pull up game … Average free throw shooter … Versatile player, but not exceptionally great in any one area … Handle is solid, but does not have any dribbling moves or a crossover … Struggles to create separation from his defender … When he drives, he does so in a straight line … Still struggles with creating offense off the dribble at times … Can be bothered by opposing players length … Struggles with finishing shots around the basket when there are longer players guarding him … Does not finish consistently through contact at the rim (is improving) … Does not have the ideal strength or length to defend bigger players as a post defender … Gets pushed off his spot sometimes with trying to post up … Does not a possess a go to move in the post …  Has some difficulty at times containing athletic wings; off screens, cuts and isolations …Dekker needs to work on creating for himself off the dribble, despite a good understanding of angles and moving without the ball, creating his own shot is an area he needs to continue to develop … As a mid-range shooter, Dekker only shot 30.2% on 2 point jumpers and continued work on this area of his game will also aid in his shot creation … Sam is a strong, fluid athlete, but lack of great lateral quickness draws concerns about his ability to defend NBA players out on the perimeter, and a 6’10’’ wingspan isn’t quite long enough to make up for a lack of direction changing speed … Must continue to get reps on his jumper, showed real potential as a shooter as a freshman, but dipping field goal,

Related to this: His youthful inexperience sometimes gets him caught out of control when competing with physically stronger men at the highest Euro level He is thin but will fill out as his frame is good.Rubio will have trouble guarding point guards in the NBA. His lateral quickness is decent but not great. Against top competition, he does have some mental lapses at times. He often backs off his defender and uses his instincts to play position defense, but in the rare moments when he guesses wrong, he can get beat on simple plays like a back-door cut, or his defender will easily dribble right by him. Some of his height and vision advantage is lost when longer players guard him. He doesnt jump at all on his jump shot and could stand to change his shooting mechanics a little.

203915,Spencer Dinwiddie,2014,2,8,38,Draft,1610612765,Detroit,Pistons,DET,Colorado,College/University,1,Spencer,Dinwiddie,,,92.0,Brian Shaw,"Strengths: Dinwiddie is a dual offensive threat, who averaged 18.9 points and 4.1 assists per 40 minutes over his last two seasons at Colorado … Dangerous in transition – glides down the floor and slithers his way to the basket … Smooth. Good body control and great touch on his floaters … Uses nifty hop and Euro steps to get to the rim…  Draws a bunch of fouls, averaging 9 FTA per 40 over his last two seasons at CU … Excellent free-throw shooter, making better than 81 percent of his attempts in each of his three seasons at CU … Solid three-point shooter, making more than 41 percent of his attempts in two of his three seasons with the Buffalos … Very effective scoring and finding open perimeter shooters when driving off the pick and roll … Tallest player classified as a point guard at the combine – his height allows him to shoot unimpeded and easily find open teammates … Makes crisp interior passes … Good off-the-ball defense – denies very well … Fast – gets down the floor quickly and can stick with talented scorers, such as Marcus Smart and Andrew Wiggins, on defense … High character guy with good intelligence. Seemingly a good teammate – enthusiastic, likable, expressive, involved, and shares the ball …   Weaknesses: Dinwiddie’s most glaring weakness is his lack of assertiveness and consistency. Scouts often wonder why his level of intensity is not at the same level at all time. Should look to be a little more selfish (assertive). Has standout ability but doesn’t always take it upon himself to be the star that he should be … Still recovering from a torn ACL that he suffered in January …  Questionable whether he is a true point guard or more a combo –  frequently played off the ball at CU, though excels in ball handling and passing … Slender build – bounces off stronger players on both ends of the floor … Avoids contact when driving – prefers to pull up or pass out rather than go all the way to the hole … Limited dribble moves … Doesn’t show much ability to create his own shot, frequently relying of screens to get open … Too dependent on his right hand – shoots with his right on drives to the left side of the rim…  Easily picked off by screens on the defensive side of the ball, which is seemingly due to a combination of a lack of awareness and strength …   Notes:  At the time of Dinwiddie’s knee injury, CU was 14-2 and ranked 15th in the country. At the time, he was averaging 14.7 points and 3.8 assists per game and shooting 46.6 percent from the field and 41.3 percent from the 3-point line … Without him, the Buffalos were a sub-500 team, losing 10 of 19 games … In all-time school history, he ranks third in free throw percentage (.830) and fourth in 3-point field goal percentage (.386) … Confident and engaging, Dinwiddie is the self-proclaimed “Mayor,” and a fan favorite.  Received the most votes by the fans at Pachoops.com for having the best moustache in the conference …   Outlook:  Assuming that he can regain his past form, Dinwiddie should be a solid NBA player …  Would fit well alongside an undersized scorer like Monta Ellis … He relies heavily on screens to get shots, is not an especially gifted ball handler, is a little too upright and stiff to defend smaller, quicker guards, and perhaps most importantly, spent a great deal of time playing off the ball in college…  If he wasn’t coming off a serious knee injury, Dinwiddie would be a good bet to be drafted late in the first round, but now, he appears destined to go somewhere in the second…Shooting guard who excels at pushing the ball in traffic … Relentless attacking the basket, particularly in transition. Fearless, aggressive, mentality attacking the rim despite a skinny frame … Good outside shooter with a quick, concise release … Very good spot up shooter … Tremendous handle for a 2-guard. Had more assists than turnovers. Impressive for a freshman who handled the ball a fair amount … Combine that handle with good speed and he is very difficult to contain when he gets a head of steam … Shows solid creativity to finish off plays in transition with scoops and up and unders, even when facing a bigger or more athletic opponent … His aggressive, attacking style results in a lot of trips to the FT line … Very efficient player. Solid decision maker. Good composure, feel for the game … Good length and fluidity … Excellent finisher, despite many of those finishes being the below the rim variety … As he gains a star reputation, many of those 50/50 foul calls that he forces refs to make are likely to go his way …","Needs to get a lot stronger … Added body strength will make him even more effective finishing around the basket and also likely improve his explosiveness … His fearless attacking style in transition can lead to charges and turnovers … Finishes more often with finger rolls than dunks. Not the most explosive athlete, but has great speed and length and should gain some explosiveness as his body develops … While he excels at spot up and transition, he needs to improve his ISO game … While his length and fluidity and focus should make him a good defender in the long run, he needs to improve in that area. He obviously puts a lot more attention into his offensive game …","  Assuming that he can regain his past form, Dinwiddie should be a solid NBA player …  Would fit well alongside an undersized scorer like Monta Ellis … He relies heavily on screens to get shots, is not an especially gifted ball handler, is a little too upright and stiff to defend smaller, quicker guards, and perhaps most importantly, spent a great deal of time playing off the ball in college…  If he wasn’t coming off a serious knee injury, Dinwiddie would be a good bet to be drafted late in the first round, but now, he appears destined to go somewhere in the second…Richard Harris 5/25/14","Averaged 10 ppg as a freshman on solid shooting numbers (43% from 3) … One of the more prolific and effective freshmen in the nation, and with the graduation of Carlon Brown, he’ll likely be given the opportunity to be Colorado’s main scorer as a sophomore …",,yes,15.5,0.107,7.8,strength dinwiddie dual offensive threat averaged 189 point 41 assist per 40 minute last two season colorado dangerous transition glide floor slithers way basket smooth good body control great touch floater us nifty hop euro step get rim draw bunch foul averaging 9 fta per 40 last two season cu excellent freethrow shooter making better 81 percent attempt three season cu solid threepoint shooter making 41 percent attempt two three season buffalo effective scoring finding open perimeter shooter driving pick roll tallest player classified point guard combine height allows shoot unimpeded easily find open teammate make crisp interior pass good offtheball defense denies well fast get floor quickly stick talented scorer marcus smart andrew wiggins defense high character guy good intelligence seemingly good teammate enthusiastic likable expressive involved share ball weakness dinwiddies glaring weakness lack assertiveness consistency scout often wonder level intensity level time look little selfish assertive standout ability doesnt always take upon star still recovering torn acl suffered january questionable whether true point guard combo frequently played ball cu though excels ball handling passing slender build bounce stronger player end floor avoids contact driving prefers pull pas rather go way hole limited dribble move doesnt show much ability create shot frequently relying screen get open dependent right hand shoot right drive left side rim easily picked screen defensive side ball seemingly due combination lack awareness strength note time dinwiddies knee injury cu 142 ranked 15th country time averaging 147 point 38 assist per game shooting 466 percent field 413 percent 3point line without buffalo sub500 team losing 10 19 game alltime school history rank third free throw percentage 830 fourth 3point field goal percentage 386 confident engaging dinwiddie selfproclaimed mayor fan favorite received vote fan pachoopscom best moustache conference outlook assuming regain past form dinwiddie solid nba player would fit well alongside undersized scorer like monta elli relies heavily screen get shot especially gifted ball handler little upright stiff defend smaller quicker guard perhaps importantly spent great deal time playing ball college wasnt coming serious knee injury dinwiddie would good bet drafted late first round appears destined go somewhere secondshooting guard excels pushing ball traffic relentless attacking basket particularly transition fearless aggressive mentality attacking rim despite skinny frame good outside shooter quick concise release good spot shooter tremendous handle 2guard assist turnover impressive freshman handled ball fair amount combine handle good speed difficult contain get head steam show solid creativity finish play transition scoop unders even facing bigger athletic opponent aggressive attacking style result lot trip ft line efficient player solid decision maker good composure feel game good length fluidity excellent finisher despite many finish rim variety gain star reputation many 5050 foul call force ref make likely go way,need get lot stronger added body strength make even effective finishing around basket also likely improve explosiveness fearless attacking style transition lead charge turnover finish often finger roll dunk explosive athlete great speed length gain explosiveness body develops excels spot transition need improve iso game length fluidity focus make good defender long run need improve area obviously put lot attention offensive game,assuming regain past form dinwiddie solid nba player would fit well alongside undersized scorer like monta elli relies heavily screen get shot especially gifted ball handler little upright stiff defend smaller quicker guard perhaps importantly spent great deal time playing ball college wasnt coming serious knee injury dinwiddie would good bet drafted late first round appears destined go somewhere secondrichard harris 52514,52.84248366,2.85,150.6010784,0.819530325,N,N,N,N,0.9814,1

Relies on talent at times on drives, attacking without a plan which will be less reliable at the next level. Settles for contested shots in the pick and roll and can be too quick with the trigger as a 3PT shooter. Has to find that balance of playing assertive while maintaining smart shot selection. Sometimes he shoots without being squared up, looking uncomfortable with a bit of a staggered stance. 3PT success decreased from freshman to sophomore year, shooting 46.4% 3PT% on 3.7 attempts per game as a freshman to 33.3% 3PT% on 4.2 attempts per game as a sophomore … Not a bad free throw shooter but it also decreased from freshman to sophomore year, shooting 79.1% FT% as a freshman to 72.7% FT% as a sophomore … Unselfish and not a bad passer but playmaking can still improve, as he ran the point in spurts. Naturally, reads the game as a scorer rather than playmaker. Although he did show improvement in the second half of the season, he didn’t have a high assist count and can work on limiting turnovers. Averaged 1.5 assists to 2.3 turnovers per game (0.7 A/TO) as a freshman and 2.7 assists to 3.1 turnovers per game (0.9 A/TO) as a sophomore … Occasionally he finishes with his right hand but overall, he favors his left hand on drives … Spaces the floor well but could move more off the ball … Can commit more on the defensive end. Can stick to his man better when defending off the ball, as he can lose track of him once the ball gets moving and he gets caught chasing behind screens. Gambles, picks up a lot of fouls reaching and gets beat biting on pump fakes. Doesn’t give the same effort on the defensive end as he did on offense … Although he was always the most talented player on the floor, he didn’t necessarily pop out as a leader. Still has a way to go in making his teammates better … Doesn’t face the same caliber competition each night like the majority of his peers, playing against freshman and sophomore JUCO competition …","Outlook: Unique situation where he’s underrated compared to other sophomore draft prospects but had a target on his back each time he took the floor throughout the season … Helped lead John A Logan to a 27-5 (16-2 conference) record as a freshman, 28-5 (18-0 conference) record as a sophomore, and had a 11 game win streak going into the national tournament before COVID-19 caused cancellation … 2019 and 2020 First-Team NJCAA Division I All-American. 2019 and 2020 Region 24 Player of the Year.

Plays the game with consistent focus and energy … Coming to the US three years ago and having never played AAU ball, he has always played a structured game … Being late to the game, he never really developed any bad habits … Has an excellent approach to the game and shows the desire to improve through hard work … Has developed his ball handling to the point where he can comfortably bring the ball up the floor, lead the break as well as take bigger opponents off the dribble from the perimeter … Shows good touch around the rim … Plays a very controlled game. Doesn’t gamble for steals or generally get out of control on drives … Really embraced the role of team leader and superstar in his junior year, ramping up his scoring output from 11.6 ppg to 19.6 ppg … Should be a solid scorer at the next level due to his ability to knock down open jumpshots consistently … Solid defender. Does a good job of contesting shots on the perimeter, utilizing his length and anticipation … Good feel for playing in the post. Uses leverage and positioning to his advantage  … Understands how to use his body to create space and shield defenders off in order to get shots off … Strong, athletic body with good muscle tone … Scores well around the rim … Shows solid use of his left hand, both ball handling and finishing with dunks and shots around the rim … Has textbook shooting mechanics, squares up, quick release with follow through … A (decent) 74% free throw shooter and and should be able to improve that over time to be an 80+% FT shooter at the next level … Shows solid leadership skills … Confident personality. Rises to the challenge as he did against Duke in Maui, in their early season match up, leading Gonzaga to the win over Zion Williamson and Duke to capture the Maui Jim’s Maui Invitational championship … Has put in a lot of work in the weight room and has a very solid frame with good core and leg strength … Great conditioning. Gonzaga often uses him to spearhead their press and he never appears winded or runs out of energy late in games … Naturally athletic frame with good muscle tone …","Needs to continue to improve his 1-on-1 skills and ability to create off the dribble, in order to enhance his shooting and scoring ability … Must continue to polish his feel for the game … Has a good wingspan, but at 6-8 is a bit small at the power forward position … Not a perfect fit at either forward position, though he could work at the next level as a match up, small ball four if he continues to get stronger and expands his shooting range … Doesn’t possess the fastest first step to get by smaller defenders … Must become a better passer and ball handler and add the ability to create pull up jumpers in rhythm … Being late to the game, (playing against high level competition) there are times that he looks a little lost when plays break down. He has moments where he makes shots that look unorthodox or shots that are off by a lot. His lack of feel at times is due to coming to the game late … At times will challenge bigger players and go into the teeth of the defense and force up contested low percentage shots, or get his shot blocked  … Only 7% of his shots were from three point range, though he did hit a very solid clip at 45% … Should look to expand his shooting range (to NBA 3) and make the three point shot a bigger part of his arsenal … Not the most physical of players at the 4 position. Could improve on his rebounding at 6.5 rebound per game … Struggles at times to keep a handle on the ball, allowing it to get poked loose. Should look to strengthen his hands and wrists with weights … Struggles some to limit opponents scoring.

Consistently runs the floor and quick, beating others up the floor. Moves well and very light on his feet for his size. Finishes above the rim with ease and quick off the ground, doesn’t need to gather before leaping. Good body control and can jump off either foot. Well balanced and under control … Very good ball-handler and smooth/shifty for his size. Has the rare ability to not only put it on the floor, but breaks down the defense, shakes his defender, and slashes to the rim off the dribble while not relying on triple threat. Also possesses rare iso offensive ability and capability to get downhill for his size and age. Quick step, changes speed and direction well with the ball. Effective crossover. Doesn’t over-dribble or dance with his defender … Can score inside and out. Has a nice jump hook and fadeaway going over either shoulder, doesn’t hesitate to use either hand around the basket, showing good touch … Solid 3PT shooting ability, stretching the floor at a respectable clip, but unlike many prospects his age, he doesn’t drift to the perimeter too often showing a good balance of playing both inside and out. Shoots well from midrange, pulling up off the dribble and out of crossovers going into his shot after getting the defenders on their heels that you don’t see often from players at any size at his age … Scoring averages: 9.2 PPG 64.5% (4th best) FG% NBPA Top 100 2021, 14 PPG 64.7% FG% (4th best) U18 Americas Championship 2022, 13.6 PPG NBPA Top 100 2022, 12.8 PPG 48.4% FG% Nike EYBL 2022 … Solid passing ability. Generally, does a good job finding open teammates, reading double teams, and can pass out of his drive … Very good rebounder on both ends. Does a good job converting offensive rebounds and reading put back/tip slam opportunities. Rebounding stats: 8 (2.5 ORPG) RPG (5th best) U18 Americas Championship 2022, 8.8 RPG NBPA Top 100 2022, 10.6 RPG (leader) Nike EYBL 2022 … Versatile defender. Has solid foot speed and stays in front of guards/wings when defending on the perimeter, even in space at times, and defends well in the post. Good timing, anticipation, and quick off the ground as a shot blocker/help defender. Blocks shots and contests well without fouling. Averaged 1.5 blocks per game at the U18 Americas Championship and 1.9 blocks per game over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Younger for his class, won’t turn 18 until December of his freshman year of college …","Maturity remains his biggest hurdle … For as talented as Jackson is, his lack of efficiency this past season was very concerning (38 FG%, 32 3FG%, 42 FG% inside the arc) … His shot selection was poor, too often wasting possessions playing hero ball and dribbling the air out of the rock … Took numerous shots early into the shot clock before his teammates could ever touch the ball, leading many to label him a ‘ballhog’ … Averaged less than 1 assist per game as a Freshman, and generally shows little to no court vision or feel for making teammates better … Too often either didn’t have a plan or had obvious pre-determined reads with the ball that were easy for the defense to take advantage of … Has a tendency to dribble with his head down and often was swarmed by defenders and forced into turnovers/offensive fouls (2.7 topg) … Sometimes you can tell that he’s new to playing extended time on the perimeter based on how he reacts to ball pressure and scramble defenses … Was not a devoted defensive player as a freshman; gave up a ton of open shots due to lax effort and often seemed unfamiliar with scouting reports and matchup tendencies … The high center of gravity he plays with and his tendency to ball watch also didn’t do him any favors on that end, particularly as a helpside defender … His focus, effort and body language both during games and on the sidelines were concerning at various points of the season, and despite his age there will be teams that keep in mind how he acts when the going gets tough for him …Doesn’t have a great length relative to height with a 6’10 wingspan … Still has room to add strength, but as mentioned earlier, has a strong frame and is projected to fill out in time as he’s still only 17 years old … Still has room to expand post-game as he won’t be able to rely on superior tools at the next levels as much. Getting to his spots and finishing may take some time adjusting … While respectable and the foundation is there, he still has room to improve 3PT consistency. 3PT shooting: 25% 3PT% on 1.6 3PT attempts per game at the NBPA Top 100 and 34.2% 3PT% on 1.9 3PT attempts per game over the Nike EYBL 2022 … Can improve as a free throw shooter.

The upside is incredible, but his situational dependence may be higher than any player in this year’s draft …Notes: Measured 6′ 8.25” barefoot, 8′ 10.00” standing reach, 214.4 lbs, 6′ 11.50” wingspan

At 6’4’’ and  (6’8.5’’ wingspan) barefoot he’ll measure up pretty well for an NBA shooting guard, he’s a well built 205-215 pounds (204 at last year’s combine) and will be able to keep up with more guards than one’s he’s outmatched against … Hart is a competitor, and was an elite defensive guard in college … Averaged 1.6 steals per game in route to a share of the Big East’s Defensive Player of the Year award … Josh also tested pretty well as an athlete last year at the combine … A 38.5’’ max vertical was one of his more impressive stats, but he doesn’t quite fit the bill as an elite overall athlete …  He fits the prototype of a 3 and D role player in the NBA, who also increased his effectiveness as a distributor at Villanova. It should also be noted that he’s incredibly coachable and mature … Josh Hart should have little trouble transitioning to the NBA from a work ethic and maturity standpoint …","While Hart is above average in terms of athletic ability, and certainly has his strengths, he’s not overly explosive … May struggle at the next level to create open looks as he lacks speed and size … Not the quickest leaper, this may catch up to him a little more against stronger competition … Lacks great size for the wing … At 22 and as a player who’s improved tremendously, his lack of perceived upside is a major factor that is preventing him from being a high pick … Defensive efficiency numbers are just average.

202335,Patrick Patterson,2010,1,14,14,Draft,1610612745,Houston,Rockets,HOU,Kentucky,College/University,1,Patrick,Patterson,,,96.0,Buck Williams,"Utilized his 3rd year to more fully develop his game, as he was relinquished of his duties of being the featured scorer with the help of Cousins, Wall and Bledsoe … Patterson has an excellent build for an NBA forward, and uses that to his advantage down low … Good feel for the basket, soft hands, seems to convert at a high rate with fundamental post moves, in particular a baby hook shot, when establishing solid position down low … Shows good toughness and a power forward’s demeanor … This past year he developed a smooth outside jump shot with encouraging mechanics for a big man, working well when spotting up off a catch and shoot … His understanding of the game and his mid-range stroke make him a likely candidate to be an efficient pick and roll player down the road … Patterson has a high basketball IQ, seems to know his limitations, while his work ethic and maturity will likely improve the chances of him earning plentiful rookie minutes … Defensively, in the paint, he can use his length to contest shots, and with a focus on using his strength to body up and play physical, he has the potential to be a nice post defender …Patterson possesses an NBA-ready body and outstanding physical abilities … Has the demeanor you want in a post player, as he relishes contact and has the willingness to bang inside … One of the most efficient players in the SEC at 18 PPG (.664 FG% and 1.66 PPS), 9.3 RPG and 2.0 BLK … He is a warrior inside who understands how to play post position with his back to the basket and relies on his deep position under the basket … One of the toughest players in the league … Does a great job of fighting for and holding down his position inside (if he doesn’t feel he is in a good position to catch the ball he will repost and fight for better position) … Patterson overpowers, out muscles and out wills most of his opponents inside … Possesses great timing on put-backs, rebounds and 2nd shot opportunities … His go-to move is to catch the ball inside and turn to his left shoulder and use his right hand baby hook effectively or drop-step and go for dunk … Patterson is very explosive and aggressive off the ground when attacking the rim … He has improved his game since last year and developed a solid outside shot from 15-16 feet (on the low post he can even turn around and shoot it off the glass) … He is very quick at changing directions, and shows solid ability to beat slower defenders off the dribble … Has the ability to draw contact first and score … Very good free-throw shooter at .778 % this year so far … Patterson also improved his rebounding ability (going from 7.7 RPG per game to 9.5 RPG per game this year) … Although he relied mostly on his body in the past, this year he has learned to box out better and make better use of his 7′2″ wingspan … Average passer with good court vision (recognizes double teams and will try to find open teammate for the open jump-shot) … Runs the floor well for his size … On the defensive end his mobility, long arms, body and athleticism make him solid … Patterson has good timing for blocking shots (2 BPG) … Possesses good lateral quickness for his size … Got his confidence back from last year’s injury (stress fracture in left ankle) … Despite being undersized, Patterson possesses the heart, determination, and athleticism to overcome these shortcomings. It also helps him that smaller power forwards such as Paul Millsap are having success in the NBA …Patterson is an exceptionally aggressive and athletic player in a man-child NBA body. His pogo-stick leaping ability allows him to be a creative finisher around the basket where he is almost automatic and can finish with either hand. He uses the glass well and is a very powerful dunker. Patterson has great hands that the ball seems to stick to. His brute strength allows him to bang down low with power forwards and be a menace on the boards. However, he is also very quick and should be able to defend the small forward in the NBA. He can pass very well, especially out of double teams, and is a team player with well-rounded statistics. He was measured with a 7-1 wingspan","If there is one thing Patterson is missing, it’s a face-up part of his game… It’s difficult to remember a time where he ever tried to beat his man or take a jump shot off the dribble this past year… For his build and strength, he is not the greatest rebounder, and at the next level when going up against taller and equally strong forwards, he could be a liability on the defensive glass …  When guarding more athletic and quicker forwards like Josh Smith, he could have a difficult time defending on the perimeter (although it seems his footwork and agility have improved over the past year) … Lacks defensive awareness, and will need to work on his help defense and positioning off the ball …Patterson is clearly undersized at PF at the next level … He won’t be as effective in the NBA as he is now unless he becomes more versatile player offensively … His court awareness is a little shaky and he will try to make a move inside with 2-3 defenders on him at the times … Patterson has to work on turning to his right shoulder and using his left hand (the majority of his points are with his right hand) … Although his shot has good mechanics, his release point is low and he may have trouble getting his shot off at the next level … Has to become a more consistent outside shooter as well. He has shown improvement, but can certainly extend his range and consistency … Not patient enough when trying to block shots and can commits unnecessary fouls being overly aggressive …Patterson is an amazing talent but does lack some important skills. He is very efficient with the ball and thus does not show extensive ball handling and dribbling skills. He also has not shown an ability to shoot the ball from the perimeter well. Short jumpers are fine, where he sometimes shoots one handed, but he seems even a bit tentative around 15 feet from the hoop and out. He is close to being between positions due to limited perimeter skills and measuring in at just 6-8 without shoes, however players with his package of strength, length, and athleticism dont come along often. There is surely a spot for him in the NBA.",,,"  A smart, mature kid who understands his role, Patterson looks like the typical productive power forward that GMs know exactly what they are going to get when they draft him… Not the highest upside, but a safe and reliable pick who rarely turns the ball over and just screams efficiency… With his improved jump shot, and the ability to add a few post moves to his repertoire, Patterson could be a nice fit right away for a team looking for stability at the 4 position, especially if they already have an established rebounding center … Jonathan Wasserman 2/27/10",yes,12.5,0.102,7.4,utilized 3rd year fully develop game relinquished duty featured scorer help cousin wall bledsoe patterson excellent build nba forward us advantage low good feel basket soft hand seems convert high rate fundamental post move particular baby hook shot establishing solid position low show good toughness power forward demeanor past year developed smooth outside jump shot encouraging mechanic big man working well spotting catch shoot understanding game midrange stroke make likely candidate efficient pick roll player road patterson high basketball iq seems know limitation work ethic maturity likely improve chance earning plentiful rookie minute defensively paint use length contest shot focus using strength body play physical potential nice post defender patterson posse nbaready body outstanding physical ability demeanor want post player relish contact willingness bang inside one efficient player sec 18 ppg 664 fg 166 pps 93 rpg 20 blk warrior inside understands play post position back basket relies deep position basket one toughest player league great job fighting holding position inside doesnt feel good position catch ball repost fight better position patterson overpowers muscle will opponent inside posse great timing putbacks rebound 2nd shot opportunity goto move catch ball inside turn left shoulder use right hand baby hook effectively dropstep go dunk patterson explosive aggressive ground attacking rim improved game since last year developed solid outside shot 1516 foot low post even turn around shoot glass quick changing direction show solid ability beat slower defender dribble ability draw contact first score good freethrow shooter 778 year far patterson also improved rebounding ability going 77 rpg per game 95 rpg per game year although relied mostly body past year learned box better make better use 72 wingspan average passer good court vision recognizes double team try find open teammate open jumpshot run floor well size defensive end mobility long arm body athleticism make solid patterson good timing blocking shot 2 bpg posse good lateral quickness size got confidence back last year injury stress fracture left ankle despite undersized patterson posse heart determination athleticism overcome shortcoming also help smaller power forward paul millsap success nba patterson exceptionally aggressive athletic player manchild nba body pogostick leaping ability allows creative finisher around basket almost automatic finish either hand us glass well powerful dunker patterson great hand ball seems stick brute strength allows bang low power forward menace board however also quick able defend small forward nba pas well especially double team team player wellrounded statistic measured 71 wingspan,one thing patterson missing faceup part game difficult remember time ever tried beat man take jump shot dribble past year build strength greatest rebounder next level going taller equally strong forward could liability defensive glass guarding athletic quicker forward like josh smith could difficult time defending perimeter although seems footwork agility improved past year lack defensive awareness need work help defense positioning ball patterson clearly undersized pf next level wont effective nba unless becomes versatile player offensively court awareness little shaky try make move inside 23 defender time patterson work turning right shoulder using left hand majority point right hand although shot good mechanic release point low may trouble getting shot next level become consistent outside shooter well shown improvement certainly extend range consistency patient enough trying block shot commits unnecessary foul overly aggressive patterson amazing talent lack important skill efficient ball thus show extensive ball handling dribbling skill also shown ability shoot ball perimeter well short jumper fine sometimes shoot one handed seems even bit tentative around 15 foot hoop close position due limited perimeter skill measuring 68 without shoe however player package strength length athleticism dont come along often surely spot nba,,33.3677193,1.65,55.05673685,0.568144593,N,N,MID,N,0.9823,1

Standing 6’10.5’’ in shoes, possessing an elite 7’5.5’’ wingspan, and a 9’2.5’’ standing reach, Allen’s ability to haul in rebounds will be one of his calling cards in the NBA … Through 22 games into his college career, Allen is pulling in a very respectable 8.4 rebounds per game, which includes a 2.9 split for offensive boards … His length, really allows him to get well above the rim with minimal effort … He’s also turned up his productivity during conference play, as he adjusts further to the NCAA game … Through 8 Big 12 games, Jarrett is pulling down 11 rebounds per game, which also included 3 straight double doubles in early Jan. Allen’s length will also allow him to protect the rim at the next level … He’s not an elite shot blocker, although good (1.6 bpg), but as he adds weight and experience, he has the ability to become a deterrent in the paint in the NBA … His immense length makes up for some deficiencies moving laterally, and he’s shown the ability to hedge successfully while defending pick and roll situations … Due to Shaquille Cleare playing the center for the Longhorns, Allen has actually played this season at the 4 spot for Shaka Smart … Allen’s ability to shoot in the mid range allows this, and it’s a nice piece of his offensive game when looking towards the NBA … Jarrett has a nice touch out to 12 feet, and good hands that allow him to catch passes around the rim, and finish at a good clip (68% at the rim according to hoop-math.com) … This foundation at such a young age make it reasonable to project him as being a player in the pick and pop game, as well as a solid roll man … His FT percentage is just 60%, but again, as he’s gained confidence throughout the season, he’s seen this element of his game improve. During Big 12 play, Allen is shooting 75% on a pretty decent 4.5 attempts per game. I wouldn’t go as far to say Jarrett projects as a high level offensive talent in the NBA, but his shooting touch gives him far more potential than many bigs his size who rely on athleticism alone to get buckets … Allen is a pretty good athlete as well … He’s a fast player for being near 7 feet tall, and is already 235 pounds. He appears to have the frame to add muscle, which he will need to do going forward.6’10 center … Good size and length … Runs the floor well with good fluidity and mobility. High activity level. Great potential as a defender. Good shot blocker with athleticism and instincts. Gets off the ground quickly. Alters a high majority of shots that come his way without fouling. Serves as an anchor and reliable paint protector. Good positioning and timing on defense … Dunks everything with authority within close … Very good rebounder … Good roll man in the pick and roll. Good hands and always alert for the pass … Appears to embrace the role of a center, doesn’t drift to the perimeter or play outside of his game … Hard working, cerebral player …  Weaknesses: Awkward free throw stance with inconsistent results. Has limited range and doesn’t have much of a face up game … Good footwork and solid foundation but lacks low post offense. Relies on putting the ball out of the defenders reach and finishing. Most of his points come from dunks and put backs. Can improve touch within close. Jump hook needs work … Has room to add strength … Still raw offensively, but shows promise …","Jarrett Allen has good end to end speed, but he’s not particularly quick laterally, and possesses a bit of an awkward gate, as he hunches over when he runs … This is not particularly a huge issue, as I feel it could be corrected and improved as he gains strength and improves his conditioning … Allen still brings the ball down too much in the lane, which can lead to being stripped, and when he executes offense in the post it is often very slow and robotic … He’s very much a work in progress on offense, and despite his size and length advantage at the NCAA level, the game still appears to be pretty fast for him, and he doesn’t handle double teams well, nor instances in which he is heavily pressured … He is a solid passer in terms of knowing where to put the ball, but he often turns the ball over when defenders dial it up a notch … He’s also not the greatest in terms of boxing out, he’s good at picking the right spot, but is often muscled out by stronger players …",Allen is a bit of a late bloomer who provides great long term potential and currently gets his worth on the defensive end. Allen will play for Shaka Smart at Texas.,"Measured 6’10.5’’ in shoes, with a 7’ 5.5’’ wingspan and an 9’2.5’’ standing reach at the 2016 Hoop Summit.  He also weighed 227 pounds at the same event."," Overall, Jarrett Allen has a lot of potential … He has the size and length to be a successful NBA big man, and rebound at a high rate, but due to his soft touch, and good hands, he also has some real promise in the face up game … He’s still figuring things out at the NCAA level, and to his credit, has improved a great deal since the fall … As a baseline, I have little trouble projecting him as a solid defensive center in the league, but if the right things were to click with him, he could really become a high level NBA big …Notes: Measured 6’10.5’’ in shoes, with a 7’ 5.5’’ wingspan and an 9’2.5’’ standing reach at the 2016 Hoop Summit.  He also weighed 227 pounds at the same event.David Ray 2/2/17",yes,20.0,0.189,11.0,looking towards next level jarrett allen size length first thing notice he court standing 6105 shoe possessing elite 755 wingspan 925 standing reach allen ability haul rebound one calling card nba 22 game college career allen pulling respectable 84 rebound per game includes 29 split offensive board length really allows get well rim minimal effort he also turned productivity conference play adjusts ncaa game 8 big 12 game jarrett pulling 11 rebound per game also included 3 straight double double early jan allen length also allow protect rim next level he elite shot blocker although good 16 bpg add weight experience ability become deterrent paint nba immense length make deficiency moving laterally he shown ability hedge successfully defending pick roll situation due shaquille cleare playing center longhorn allen actually played season 4 spot shaka smart allen ability shoot mid range allows nice piece offensive game looking towards nba jarrett nice touch 12 foot good hand allow catch pass around rim finish good clip 68 rim according hoopmathcom foundation young age make reasonable project player pick pop game well solid roll man ft percentage 60 he gained confidence throughout season he seen element game improve big 12 play allen shooting 75 pretty decent 45 attempt per game wouldnt go far say jarrett project high level offensive talent nba shooting touch give far potential many bigs size rely athleticism alone get bucket allen pretty good athlete well he fast player near 7 foot tall already 235 pound appears frame add muscle need going forward610 center good size length run floor well good fluidity mobility high activity level great potential defender good shot blocker athleticism instinct get ground quickly alters high majority shot come way without fouling serf anchor reliable paint protector good positioning timing defense dunk everything authority within close good rebounder good roll man pick roll good hand always alert pas appears embrace role center doesnt drift perimeter play outside game hard working cerebral player weakness awkward free throw stance inconsistent result limited range doesnt much face game good footwork solid foundation lack low post offense relies putting ball defender reach finishing point come dunk put back improve touch within close jump hook need work room add strength still raw offensively show promise,jarrett allen good end end speed he particularly quick laterally posse bit awkward gate hunch run particularly huge issue feel could corrected improved gain strength improves conditioning allen still brings ball much lane lead stripped executes offense post often slow robotic he much work progress offense despite size length advantage ncaa level game still appears pretty fast doesnt handle double team well instance heavily pressured solid passer term knowing put ball often turn ball defender dial notch he also greatest term boxing he good picking right spot often muscled stronger player,allen bit late bloomer provides great long term potential currently get worth defensive end allen play shaka smart texas,53.26737289,2.05,109.1981144,1.565311427,N,N,N,N,0.9827,1

Very explosive off the floor when attacking the bucket and finishes strong … As a shooter he improved since last year and feels more confident taking shots outside the 3pt line and creating off the dribble; his mechanics and follow-through look fluid; good elevation on his shot … If he catches the ball and his feet are set and pointed towards the basket he usually will knock down shots … Defensively he is good, thanks to his length and can guard multiple positions … His lateral quickness is impressive for his size and he does a solid job at moving his feet (good P&R defender and closes well on the perimeter staying in front of guards) … Plays with lot of emotion … A competitive player that hustles for loose balls and brings energy on the court …One of the most intriguing international prospects … At 6’11, he is not only comfortable shooting the ball from deep (with nice form and a smooth release), but he is more than capable of handling it in transition and running the fast break … He is a very active, energy type player who plays extremely hard and rarely takes plays off … A great motor to go along with good hands and feet, allows him to play a variety of positions on the floor … Shows potential to become a full time player on the perimeter, he is capable of putting the ball on the floor and attacking the basket … Has the explosiveness to get by the defender and to finish above the rim in traffic … He is a good slasher and he moves extremely well without the ball, either using screens or cuts to get into scoring positions … He is a very good rebounder, showing good instincts and willingness to attack the glass … For a young player of his size, his passing ability might be the most surprising, he can find teammates with pinpoint passes and he can also do it off the dribble … Defensively, his length and athleticism allow him to block and alter many shots as well as get into the passing lanes … The experience that he is getting playing during key moments on the biggest European stage has done wonders to both his development and maturation … Not many 18 year olds are put in a position where they are expected to contribute on a nightly basis, but he has been asked exactly that and has performed…","Vesely needs to continue improving his offensive skills.

A player with his combination of size, and point guard skills is very rare. The only player to have this in the past was Magic Johnson. There are no more than 5 players in the NBA that have the vision and passing skills of LeBron. On top of all this he’s a physical specimen. The sky is truly the limit. He has developed his body to make it a great strength, he is a legit 240 pounds and has very little body fat. Has an ""NBA body"" at 18. He has all the gifts to play PG, but he will likely have to start at the 2 and 3 positions before he can really run a team from the point guard position. But when you have a player with his type of passing skills, you want the offense to run through him every time down the floor, making point guard his natural position. He has met and surpassed the hype every step of the way. The game just comes so easily to him, he’s the epitome of a hoops prodigy. He has changed the face of highschool athletics with Nationally televised games being carried by ESPN. He has lived up to the hype and then some every step of the way. Carmelo Anthony has a better jumpshot than LeBron, and a NCAA title under his belt. But LeBron has far superior upside.","All the hype at such a young age is inconceivable. Can he stay focused and continue to work hard to improve his game? His free throw shooting must improve. Defensive intensity must get better. Right now, he’s under 70%, but this should definitely improve with experience. LeBron still tends to go for the spectacular at times when a solid play is all that’s necessary.

202703,Nikola Mirotic,2011,1,23,23,Draft,1610612745,Houston,Rockets,HOU,Real Madrid Baloncesto (Spain),Other Team/Club,1,Nikola,Mirotic,,,82.0,Zarko Carbakapa/Jason Kapono,"A 6’10” forward with potential. Actually the potential has already become a reality this season with Real Madrid, one of the traditional powerhouses and present at the recently played Euroleague Final Four. A good frame  … Yet he shows good balance, mobility and also a very nice wingspan … He’s got pretty good hands and a soft shooting touch, offering good reliability from beyond the arch up to the foul line. Shot selection is really excellent … He’s also willing to take the big shots to help win games … Might not be the quickest shooter, but his release and rhythm are good and he can create shots off the dribble when necessary. Able to score from the outside, able to penetrate and also a skilled low post player with a variety of moves … He handles the ball well with both hands for a guy of his size, and often helps to dribble the ball up court when the guard is being overplayed. Offensively Mirotic is tremendously versatile. Even if he’s missing better strength and athleticism, a good first step and very controlled drives gets him to draw many fouls. Adding to that a very high basketball IQ, good court awareness and anticipation, which allows him to make very quick decisions once he receives the ball. Spin moves (including over baseline foot), left and right up and unders and jump hooks, turn around jumpers, 45 degrees bank shots and shotfakes all form in a natural part of his repertoire. And he’s a reliable finisher inside. Apart from scoring himself, he contributes in the functioning of his team by making the ball move around on the perimeter. He also knows how to post up, seal off his position and maintain it. Being a good passer with an even better court vision enables him to find his teammates from the low post or out of dribble when driving towards the basket. In offensive rebounding he continuously tries to find a good position, often succeeding follow ups or at least getting touches to obtain a new possession. Defending pick and roll isn’t an issue either, considering his physical assets to hedge and recuperate as required. At this point defensively he can be matched up with both small and power forwards. Not a great shotblocker in the way of a top leaper who goes for each shot, nonetheless he manages to block a fair share of them due to very good help side positioning, timing and awareness.","Even though agility and leaping are just average, surprisingly he’s quite quick off his feet and is able to run the floor well when he puts his mind to it … Over the years, there have been moments where a lack of motivation and concentration affected his running effort and activity on offense … Overall I would catalogue his athleticism as just okay for NBA standards … Has a good frame but will need to add additional strength … He is a better set shooter than creating shots for himself … He’s much more effective in half court offenses than in one on one fastbreak situations. When he’s on the receiving end in pick and roll plays, he mostly steps out the 3 point line and continues just occasionally inside. Even though he usually does box out and picks up defensive rebounds, rebounding is an aspect that he can still improve significantly. Whereas he can successfully defend speed (in Europe), against power it’s a lot more complicated. He’s unable to stop somebody who takes him one on one to the basket, as his body lacks the strength to contain many players …While he can run the floor and has some athleticism, he is not a speed demon nor does he possess good jumping ability … While he is a tremendously skilled player he does not have any post moves and is a 6""10 player who gets most of his scoring opportunities from the perimeter or fast breaks … Lacks the body strength to do much inside … Needs to get stronger/tougher ..Most of his interior scoring is done on broken plays and offensive rebounds … While his scoring ability is very advanced, he needs to focus on developing other aspects of his game so he can become a more complete player … For a player with his talents he can disappear from time to time …",,"Spanish naturalized, born in Montenegro. In Europe expect Mirotic to become and remain a very important player for any of the top teams for many years to come. Without any doubt he has absolute Euroleague star player potential. However for his development and to get the maximum out of his basketball career, the situation where he ends up might be crucial to making it or not across the Atlantic.Notes: A native of Montenegro, became a citizen of Spain in 2010 and played for the Bronze Medalist FIBA Europe Under-20 Spanish team leading the squad in scoring …",,yes,,,,610 forward potential actually potential already become reality season real madrid one traditional powerhouse present recently played euroleague final four good frame yet show good balance mobility also nice wingspan he got pretty good hand soft shooting touch offering good reliability beyond arch foul line shot selection really excellent he also willing take big shot help win game might quickest shooter release rhythm good create shot dribble necessary able score outside able penetrate also skilled low post player variety move handle ball well hand guy size often help dribble ball court guard overplayed offensively mirotic tremendously versatile even he missing better strength athleticism good first step controlled drive get draw many foul adding high basketball iq good court awareness anticipation allows make quick decision receives ball spin move including baseline foot left right unders jump hook turn around jumper 45 degree bank shot shotfakes form natural part repertoire he reliable finisher inside apart scoring contributes functioning team making ball move around perimeter also know post seal position maintain good passer even better court vision enables find teammate low post dribble driving towards basket offensive rebounding continuously try find good position often succeeding follow ups least getting touch obtain new possession defending pick roll isnt issue either considering physical asset hedge recuperate required point defensively matched small power forward great shotblocker way top leaper go shot nonetheless manages block fair share due good help side positioning timing awareness,even though agility leaping average surprisingly he quite quick foot able run floor well put mind year moment lack motivation concentration affected running effort activity offense overall would catalogue athleticism okay nba standard good frame need add additional strength better set shooter creating shot he much effective half court offense one one fastbreak situation he receiving end pick roll play mostly step 3 point line continues occasionally inside even though usually box pick defensive rebound rebounding aspect still improve significantly whereas successfully defend speed europe power lot complicated he unable stop somebody take one one basket body lack strength contain many player run floor athleticism speed demon posse good jumping ability tremendously skilled player post move 610 player get scoring opportunity perimeter fast break lack body strength much inside need get strongertougher interior scoring done broken play offensive rebound scoring ability advanced need focus developing aspect game become complete player player talent disappear time time,,46.56095238,2.1,97.77799999,TBD,N,N,N,TBD,0.9844,1

Last season Carr shot just 32 percent from downtown on three attempts per game … This year, however, he has ascended his three-point percentage all the way to 46 percent and has done so on just under six attempts per game . Carr’s improved three-point shot has opened up the rest of his offensive arsenal, which allowed prompted him average a Big Ten best 19.9 points per game this season … Carr has very good size and length for a lead guard at 6-5 and can get shots off over smaller defenders … He is an excellent shot creator off the dribble and has become a serious threat to score in the mid-range area via pull-ups, step backs, spin dribbles, etc … When he gets inside the arc he does a great job of using his size and length to shoot over the top of smaller defenders … Carr also can take other guards down in the post, where he is comfortable operating as a scorer or playmaker … He has proficient scoring instincts and understands how to get to spots where he is most effective in different situations … Carr has also improved as a pick-and-roll ball handler and plays with nice patience in the half-court. Rarely does he get too sped up or out of control when coming off of ball screens … Carr is a capable playmaker as well and has improved his assist to turnover ratio in his sophomore season … When he keeps his eyes up and does not try to force the issue, he has shown flashes of solid vision … Carr is a good free-throw shooter as well, at nearly 80 percent for the second season in a row … He his size and length, he has some defensive upside as well, despite not being the most explosive vertical athlete … If he can learn to become more active with his hands on the ball, he could be a guy that records a lot of steals and blocks … Carr is also a good rebounder for a lead guard, averaging nearly five boards per game in each of his first two seasons … He is also clearly not afraid of the big moment, as he made some big time shots late in games this season, most notably to beat Ohio State on the road and one to tie it regulation against Minnesota with time winding down …","Carr lacks elite burst off the dribble and does not always explode to the basket when he turns the corner … He is also not the most explosive leaper, which hinders his ability to finish at the rim at times … That will limit his defensive upside in the NBA, as he is not quite big enough to guard NBA two-guards, but he does not have the lateral quickness to consistently stay in front of the dynamic point guards that he will see most nights in the pros … Carr also struggles to score against more physical defenders … Despite having a solid 6-5 foundation to work with, he checks in under 210 pounds and can be pushed off his spots fairly easily, so he will need to add some strength at the next level … There are questions if Carr’s improved shooting may be a bit of a fluke … Mechanically, there are no glaring hitches to his release, but his ball does not have great rotation … Will he be able to get away with this behind a deeper NBA three-point line? The biggest knock on Carr at this stage is his inefficiency … Last year he shot just 37 percent from the field, and while he did improve this season, he still made only a pedestrian 41 percent of his field goal attempts … Carr is much more of a volume scorer, as he had to take a lot of shots from the field in many of his high-scoring games this season … A big reason for that is he does not get to the free-throw line at a high rate … For the second season in a row, Carr attempted just 4.8 free throw attempts per game, which is indicative of his tendency to settle for contested jump shots at times … His shot selection needs some work, as he is a bit ball dominant and often tries to play hero ball instead of running the offense like you typically want from a true point guard … The other major concern with Carr is that, outside of his perimeter shooting, he really has not improved substantially in any area since last year … Obviously, he scored the ball at a higher rate this year, but he made just marginal strides as both a playmaker and a defender … With his limited athleticism, he is going to have to become more than just a volume scorer if he plans to carve out any substantial role for an NBA team …",,"Ranked No. 50 in 2016 ESPN Top 100 recruits…ESPN four-star recruit…ESPN top-rated player from Pennsylvania…Named the 2016 Pennsylvania Player of the Year by USA Today and by PA Sports Writers in 2015 and 2016… Helped lead Roman Catholic to back-to-back PIAA AAAA State Championships with teammates Nazeer Bostick and Lamar Stevens…Played with AAU team ""Team Final”…Named to the Big Ten All-Freshman team, the fourth Nittany Lion to be honored…Started all 33 games en route to honorable mention All-Big Ten… Broke the Nittany Lion freshman assist record…First-Team All-Big Ten selection as sophomore, leading conference in scoring at 19.9 points per game …",,yes,,,,sophomore season tony carr blossomed firstteam allbig ten point guard following freshman season big reason muchimproved jump shot particularly beyond arc last season carr shot 32 percent downtown three attempt per game year however ascended threepoint percentage way 46 percent done six attempt per game carrs improved threepoint shot opened rest offensive arsenal allowed prompted average big ten best 199 point per game season carr good size length lead guard 65 get shot smaller defender excellent shot creator dribble become serious threat score midrange area via pullups step back spin dribble etc get inside arc great job using size length shoot top smaller defender carr also take guard post comfortable operating scorer playmaker proficient scoring instinct understands get spot effective different situation carr also improved pickandroll ball handler play nice patience halfcourt rarely get sped control coming ball screen carr capable playmaker well improved assist turnover ratio sophomore season keep eye try force issue shown flash solid vision carr good freethrow shooter well nearly 80 percent second season row size length defensive upside well despite explosive vertical athlete learn become active hand ball could guy record lot steal block carr also good rebounder lead guard averaging nearly five board per game first two season also clearly afraid big moment made big time shot late game season notably beat ohio state road one tie regulation minnesota time winding,carr lack elite burst dribble always explode basket turn corner also explosive leaper hinders ability finish rim time limit defensive upside nba quite big enough guard nba twoguards lateral quickness consistently stay front dynamic point guard see night pro carr also struggle score physical defender despite solid 65 foundation work check 210 pound pushed spot fairly easily need add strength next level question carrs improved shooting may bit fluke mechanically glaring hitch release ball great rotation able get away behind deeper nba threepoint line biggest knock carr stage inefficiency last year shot 37 percent field improve season still made pedestrian 41 percent field goal attempt carr much volume scorer take lot shot field many highscoring game season big reason get freethrow line high rate second season row carr attempted 48 free throw attempt per game indicative tendency settle contested jump shot time shot selection need work bit ball dominant often try play hero ball instead running offense like typically want true point guard major concern carr outside perimeter shooting really improved substantially area since last year obviously scored ball higher rate year made marginal stride playmaker defender limited athleticism going become volume scorer plan carve substantial role nba team,,0.0,3.5,0.0,TBD,Y,Y,Y,TBD,0.9854,1

He projects to be among the NBA’s most elusive guards from day one … His elite burst and ball handling allow him to create via the pick and roll or isolation (21.2 points per 40 minutes), and he does a good job of drawing contact and getting to the free throw line (7.5 free throw attempts per 40 minutes) … Fox still needs to add more consistency with his shot, but he is a capable mid range shooter off the dribble with sound mechanics … His jumper in the long run is encouraging as he gets great elevation and releases the ball high … When he cannot get all the way to the rim, he utilizes an impressive floater with good touch … He combines his quickness with the ability to drive with either hand, and he does a great job of changing gears with the ball in his hands … He uses a variety of dribble moves and counter moves to freeze his defender from hang dribbles, hesitations, hard crosses, in and outs, etc … Fox also demonstrates great footwork on his crossover into his pull up jump shot, where he is capable of knocking it down if the defense sags off too far … Off the pick and roll, he is an absolute mismatch for big men that occasionally get caught switching on him; he will use hard in and out dribbles that cover a lot of ground to blow by defenders and get to the basket … He can also cover a lot of ground with the dribble and rarely is there any wasted movement with the ball … Despite being taller for a lead guard, he has a low dribble that makes him much more explosive and difficult to contain … He is constantly keeping the defense guessing by playing high to low and slow to fast, which really aids him when his jumper is not working for him … Fox is not an elite facilitator yet, but he has solid vision (5.8 assists per 40 minutes) … His ability to collapse the defense on the drive points towards high upside as a playmaker … He also has the size to see over the top of the defense with an improving pick and roll game as well … Fox has good vision in space and always keeps his head up in transition, showing the ability to deliver accurate passes with either hand to teammates running the floor … Fox has outstanding potential as a defender as well with his size, length, lateral quickness, and instincts … He also has elite reaction time with quick hands and high activity off the ball … At times he will pressure full court and make it very difficult for opposing ball handlers to initiate an offense … He shows great motor in this end of the court as well, as he does en exemplary job of helping off the ball, and still closing out to his man under control when the ball is kicked out. He does an outstanding job of stopping his man’s first move and forcing him to change directions … He anticipates passing lanes very well and has active hands on the ball to force turnovers …6’3 shifty left handed point guard … Good size and length for the position … Explosive athleticism and high skill level. Changes speeds very well. Great lead guard in transition. Pushes the ball at every opportunity and is a blur in the open floor. Elite quickness: quick hands, feet, and great reaction time … Good court vision and passing ability. Great touch on lob passes and floaters. Handles the ball very well … Has the ability to avoid traps and break a press by himself … Has good body control; plays with a lot of creativity and craftiness … Gets where he wants off the dribble and breaks down the defense efficiently … Uses hop steps to get to the middle of the floor and avoids contact. Swift footwork in traffic … Can score from multiple spots on the floor. Very good midrange scorer where he can get to at will. Good pull up jumper … Has range out to three … Rebounds well for a guard … Top notch defender especially on the ball, can rip good ball handlers in one on one situations … Great anticipation in the passing lanes. Great defensive tools moving forward with his length, quickness, and instincts …","The biggest obstacle for Fox in his transition to the NBA is his lack of a consistent jump shot … Fox made just 31% of his pull-up jumpers, and 20% of his spot up attempts in the half court this season, but he connected on a far more respectable 55% and 36% of those attempts respectively in March … When his jumper is not working, his half-court scoring becomes much more limited and the defense can sag off of him, which somewhat negates his elite quickness … One piece of his shot that he could fix is his tendency to flex his elbow too more, creating almost a slingshot-like release … Fox does not have NBA range at this stage and is much more effective inside the arc; he needs to work on being balanced more consistently on his pull-ups … Fox still is learning to find the right balance between scoring and facilitating … He has a tendency to get too sped up when going to the rim and be a little out of control … He does not always anticipate a play well before they happen, and he can work on his timing with passes … He could also work on his timing and patience off the pick and roll, as he can be especially turnover prone in this department … Fox is still young but he will need to add strength and fill out his wiry frame to hold up over time against the bigger guards in the league … He may struggle initially with bigger guards on defense and finishing through contact in the NBA … He has potential to be a lockdown defender, but sometimes he can be a bit too upright on the ball, which mitigates his lateral quickness …Can be a streaky shooter. More of a scorer than consistent shooter right now … Has a slight frame. Very light at 175 pounds … Lacks ideal strength in both upper and lower body, although he has added some muscle tone over the past year … Can score in traffic but playing through contact will be an obstacle at the college level and beyond … Definitely shows good passing ability but can put too much heat on passes at unnecessary times. Can try to do too much at times, can play a bit more under control and limit turnovers. Can improve overall as a decision maker and could benefit by keeping the game simple … Can improve as a leader and floor general. Also, setting the pace of the game … Has room to improve in the half court …","Fox enters his college career as Kentucky’s next elite point guard prospect.

Also has great range on his jump shot. His shooting is what gives him such great intrigue … Didn’t show it often at Kentucky, but proved he could knock down threes consistently at the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit … Excellent in pick and pop plays … Some of his post moves (turnaround hook shots with either hand) show promise … His potential is his real selling point right now … His performance at the Nike Hoop Summit in which he dominated Thon Maker in practice and excelled throughout the week and in the game sold many scouts on his upside and some even thought he could be the top overall pick … Has a frame that should allow him to add more bulk without it affecting his speed and athleticism … Has a great attitude, and by all accounts a smart, high character kid …7 foot forward/center that can score from anywhere on the floor … Smooth shooting mechanics. Gets great elevation on his jump shot. Excellent pull up jumper. Has a high release point, hard for defenders to contest … Can score off the catch or dribble … Scores and passes out of double, even triple teams. Sees the floor well for a bigman … Great frame, will add strength with time. His shoulders and legs show excellent muscle tone and have improved considerably over the past 2 years  … Rare ability to create own shot for a player with his size … Great attitude and work ethic. Vocal leader and very coachable … Great footwork and advanced scoring arsenal for a such a young player, doesn’t rely on physical tools … Good defender, has shot blocking instincts and gets off the ground well, doesn’t leave his feet on shot fakes … Rebounds in his area … Stays poised, doesn’t get rattled under pressure …  Great ambidexterity … Student of the game … Possesses a great attitude. Great work ethic, and extremely coachable …","Never quite lived up to his billing or preseason hype at UK. Whether due to too high of expectations, too much pressure, or just a lack of readiness to perform at the college level, Labissiere’s one season at Kentucky was a major disappointment to say the least … Missing junior year of high school and lack of overall experience seemed to catch up with him in his lone year of college … Must develop into more of a killer and learn to flip the switch from his nice-guy-off-the-floor personality … Seemed to lack the intensity and energy to succeed when he entered games …  Doesn’t have the muscle or toughness at this point to bang on the interior … Often gets pushed around and easily moved out of the way by stronger players on both ends of the floor … Must add strength if he’s going to realize his potential in the league … Had a few games where he seemed to finally put things together, but never was able to sustain it … Committed fouls way too often when on the court … Developed slowly as the season progressed … Relies too much on his athleticism at times … Must learn better fundamentals and develop a few go to post moves … Floated through possessions and games … Too often would get lost on the court … Didn’t do much to stand out when he wasn’t involved regularly in the offense … Doesn’t seem to understand how to fully utilize his athleticism, and is hesitant to explode with aggression around the rim … There are cultural and development factors at play as he came from Haiti (in 2010) and is late at picking up the game and playing in a structured environment at a high level … Therefore it is misguided to just label him ""soft"" or a ""bust"" … Appears extremely sensitive and didn’t react well to the in-your-face motivational coaching style of Coach Calipari … Seems that he will need to develop a tougher mindset in order to handle trash talking and criticism to succeed … Still very raw as a player and seems to get down on himself and lose confidence easily … A player whose NBA success will probably be contingent upon landing in the right ""nurturing"" situation … Rebounding should improve as he gains strength and toughness …Labissiere is such an advanced young player; we are reaching as he doesn’t possess many weaknesses. He still has room to get stronger physically, particularly his legs … He could have been more active when trying to block shots as a help defender and rebounder, but may have been saving his energy for offense as he had to do almost everything for his inferior Reach Your Dream Prep … He doesn’t have a soft reputation but can still be more aggressive … Added strength will help his ability to play physical … Can develop into a better leader over time. Some injury concern exists after missing JR year with back INJ …","Has to be considered a project, but if he can become tougher and gain the competitiveness and desire to compete at a high level at all times, he has a very high ceiling … Labissiere definitely could have used more time at Kentucky to refine and shore up his game, but his potential will likely get him selected in the lottery … If Labissiere can add muscle and strength and remain a threat to knock down perimeter shots he could become a valuable player today’s NBA … While his deficiencies were brought to light, he never seemed disgruntled with the lack of success or role during his time as a Wildcat … The team that selects him will likely need to be extremely patient with him, in order to get the most out of his potential …","2015 Jordan Brand Classic member … 2015 Nike Hoop Summit World Team member … Native of Haiti … Survived the 2010 earthquake before moving to the United States …Due to transfer rules, Labissiere played his senior year with newly formed Reach Your Dream Prep, however he made the most of his senior season … After sitting out the majority of junior season with a back injury, he was able to showcase his talent this year … Although RYD was inferior to some of the powerhouses they played against, Labissiere was positive through the whole experience and caught the eye of evaluators who haven’t seen him play in a while … Kentucky is losing most of their production going into next season but Labissiere will contribute immediately and projects to be one of the NCAA’s best … His

203897,Zach LaVine,2014,1,13,13,Draft,1610612750,Minnesota,Timberwolves,MIN,California-Los Angeles,College/University,1,Zach,LaVine,,,95.0,Russell Westbrook,"Blessed with truly high level explosiveness, LaVine was one of the most intriguing prospects in college basketball last season … Shows electric speed and quickness, and is certainly one of the best leapers in the 2014 draft class … Really good body control as well … Pretty long … His upside as a prospect has a way of jumping out of the TV screen when you watch him play … Plays an exciting and fairly flashy style, and is a highlight reel dunker in the transition game … Is a magnet for run-outs, as his speed and acceleration allows him to generally be one of the first players down the floor after missed shots … Has a sweet looking jump shot, and his range extends past the NBA 3-point line … Also blessed with a swift (yet unorthodox) release and a strong ability to create space to get his shots off … Able to hit shots off of screens or off the dribble, making him a guy who must be accounted for no matter what on the perimeter … More than adequate ball-handling ability … Will be a tough cover due to his athleticism and shooting skills, as he can slash when crowded or stop and pop if the defender gives him space … Gets great elevation and has a high release giving him a great ability to get shots off … Has the ability to put up points in bunches … Already garnered experience playing as an instant offense threat off the bench in his lone year at UCLA, and that role will likely benefit him at the NBA level, as he gains experience … Would likely be most effective playing in an up-tempo system … Some think LaVine could develop into a combo guard at the next level, and he has the physical and athletic tools to do so … Shows finesse as a player, and is extremely fluid and smooth … A late blooming prospect, who wasn’t a highly touted recruit until midway through his Sr. season of high school … Could really just be scratching the surface of his true ability …At 6’5 LaVine is one of the top athletes not only of his class but in all of college basketball … LaVine has the athleticism to win the NBA Dunk contest next year, his freakish leaping ability and smoothness is on a truly elite level … Grew 5 inches in the last 3 years going from a short quick point guard to a player with the size to player either backcourt position … Not your typical point guard by any means, but the prototype of the new NBA PG: strong, quick, and excellent in transition as well as half court situations … His verticality and explosiveness are off the charts and he uses them to finish around the rim with powerful dunks but also to jump stop and elevate in a dime … The long arms and skinny body are perfect for a wing but as a point guard he will have to develop his upper body and become stronger to handle the physicality of the PG position … His game resembles Westbrook, great in transition, quick … Defensively he has very quick hands but he relies a little too much on his athleticism to save himself … Hard worker, seems a little shy, he impressed many people during summer workouts with UCLA where he could be the last gift of an impressive list of NBA players left by coach Howland.","LaVine needs to develop more consistency and improve his basketball IQ … Has a tendency to settle for too many pull up jump shots and doesn’t attack the basket nearly as much as he should off the dribble … Got to the foul line at a poor rate for someone with his shot creating potential  last season (1.8 FTA per night on 69%) … Pretty thin and frail, needs to put on more weight … Not a physical player at all, and really struggles with any aspect of the game dealing with contact right now … Has a raw feel for the game, and decides to take some bad shots at times … Though he’s projected by many to be a combo guard, LaVine didn’t show a great ability to handle double teams and struggled some when pressured … Is a pretty underwhelming defensive player, and will have a tough time finding consistent minutes on an NBA team until he shows more effort and strength on this end … Doesn’t seem to be a very tough player. Body strength will obviously help his ability to play through contact … Though he has good shooting skills, his jumper faded badly down the stretch last season and rendered him pretty ineffective throughout the month of March … Struggles mightily to contribute when his jumper isn’t falling … Is a very promising prospect, but will need time to develop overall before he’s ready to play consistently in the NBA …Doesn’t blow by people nearly as much as he should, too often he is satisfied with his jumpshot and although he has a far from perfect shooting technique, he’s fairly consistent with it … He needs to learn to get to the basket in half court situations, and part of that is getting stronger, but he also needs to get tougher mentality … Improving that aspect of his game will really elevate his game into the stratosphere … His ball handling is great but his decision-making needs to improve if he is going to take his game to another level … Consistency. He will have to learn to bring it every possession 100% … Not a highly vocal guy, so if he wants to be a point guard, that is an area he should focus on improving …",,"Notes: A late bloomer. Flew under the radar for most of his high school career but ultimately moved into the top 50 in his senior season … Not has hyped as many of his colleagues from the dream class of 2013 but he has all the tools to become a great point guard/combo guard in the NBA, and may actually be the best incoming freshman prospect in the Pac 12 … Measured 6’3 (in shoes) 167 lbs, with a 6’6 wingspan at the 2012 LeBron James Skills Academy …"," LaVine is another one of the Seattle-bred players who shows an intriguing skill set and will find himself playing in the NBA next season … His elite level, explosive athletic ability makes him an eye-opening player, and his jump shot and upside add more fuel to the fire … He needs to gain weight, polish and develop a better understanding of the game, but overall LaVine is a pretty impressive prospect who will only be 19 when he is selected in the draft … Drafting LaVine is a little bit like taking a player out of high school. He will require patience, but few in this draft have as much long term potential … Look for him to be a certain 1st round pick , with a chance to jump up into the lottery …Jorrye Nixon 5/14/14",yes,17.4,0.082,12.2,blessed truly high level explosiveness lavine one intriguing prospect college basketball last season show electric speed quickness certainly one best leaper 2014 draft class really good body control well pretty long upside prospect way jumping tv screen watch play play exciting fairly flashy style highlight reel dunker transition game magnet runouts speed acceleration allows generally one first player floor missed shot sweet looking jump shot range extends past nba 3point line also blessed swift yet unorthodox release strong ability create space get shot able hit shot screen dribble making guy must accounted matter perimeter adequate ballhandling ability tough cover due athleticism shooting skill slash crowded stop pop defender give space get great elevation high release giving great ability get shot ability put point bunch already garnered experience playing instant offense threat bench lone year ucla role likely benefit nba level gain experience would likely effective playing uptempo system think lavine could develop combo guard next level physical athletic tool show finesse player extremely fluid smooth late blooming prospect wasnt highly touted recruit midway sr season high school could really scratching surface true ability 65 lavine one top athlete class college basketball lavine athleticism win nba dunk contest next year freakish leaping ability smoothness truly elite level grew 5 inch last 3 year going short quick point guard player size player either backcourt position typical point guard mean prototype new nba pg strong quick excellent transition well half court situation verticality explosiveness chart us finish around rim powerful dunk also jump stop elevate dime long arm skinny body perfect wing point guard develop upper body become stronger handle physicality pg position game resembles westbrook great transition quick defensively quick hand relies little much athleticism save hard worker seems little shy impressed many people summer workout ucla could last gift impressive list nba player left coach howland,lavine need develop consistency improve basketball iq tendency settle many pull jump shot doesnt attack basket nearly much dribble got foul line poor rate someone shot creating potential last season 18 fta per night 69 pretty thin frail need put weight physical player really struggle aspect game dealing contact right raw feel game decides take bad shot time though he projected many combo guard lavine didnt show great ability handle double team struggled pressured pretty underwhelming defensive player tough time finding consistent minute nba team show effort strength end doesnt seem tough player body strength obviously help ability play contact though good shooting skill jumper faded badly stretch last season rendered pretty ineffective throughout month march struggle mightily contribute jumper isnt falling promising prospect need time develop overall he ready play consistently nba doesnt blow people nearly much often satisfied jumpshot although far perfect shooting technique he fairly consistent need learn get basket half court situation part getting stronger also need get tougher mentality improving aspect game really elevate game stratosphere ball handling great decisionmaking need improve going take game another level consistency learn bring every possession 100 highly vocal guy want point guard area focus improving,,60.72612613,1.6,97.1618018,0.950644756,N,N,N,N,0.9866,1
203993,Alessandro Gentile,2014,2,23,53,Draft,1610612750,Minnesota,Timberwolves,MIN,Olimpia Milano (Italy),Other Team/Club,0,Alessandro,Gentile,,,86.0,Sasha Danilovic,"Although he’s still young (not yet 21), he has been playing professionally since he was 16 with enough success to be considered one of the future stars of Italian basketball … It took him some time to adjust his game to the senior level, but his greatest strength is the confidence that he has in himself … Sometimes perceived as arrogant, and there may be some truth in that, he seems to have matured considerably over the last 6 months … As a big 6’7 guard, Gentile is very skilled and aggressive when he decides to attack the rim … His ability to attack openings and finish around the rim handling contacts makes him potentially one of the most dominant players in Europe for the next 10/15 years … He is sort of the ""Italian Melo"" in the style of physicality and nose for scoring that he brings to the table. In Europe, he reminds of the great Sasha Danilovic in how easily he can put the ball on the floor to attack the close out, despite being so tall and big and how skilled he is in controlling his body and making the right decision … Left and right are equally adept, and when he’s around the rim, he can finish with floaters, power moves or nice finger rolls … Combined with his physicality and the control of his body explains his success in transition, where he often explodes for powerful dunks … His post game is very effective and being such a big guard, he knows how to take advantage of it, though he definitely likes to attack opponents from the dribble first and foremost… A big plus is the movement without the ball, he understand the game and moves without it to free himself to get open … Defensively he uses his body strength and good foot speed to create problems to his opponents, though he is not an elite defender he is extremely competitive and doesn’t mind taking on the opponent’s best player … One of the best international players born in 1992, and possibly the best prospect of this age… Certainly the best outside players in the group … Plays like a mini-Carmelo Anthony: the combination of quickness and size (6’6” for 230 lbs) is really amazing, and the talent is equally notable … His shot and his ability to finish in traffic make him a real scoring machine: in last “Città di Roma Tournament” he score 37.5 points per game, and in European Championship Under 18 he averaged 23.0 ppg (41% 3p fg) … He is an underrated passer and his maturity makes him  ready to play at high level … His athleticism allows him to defend against guards and small forwards when he feels like it …","Even if his body is solid, he still lacks proper muscles … He lacks elite athleticism and explosiveness, for this reason the physical impact of his body will be less effective against bigger NBA level athletes … His shot mechanics have a big flaw: lacking fluidity with a slow release, with a little pause before the ball leaves his hand. This makes the trajectory of his shot predictable and flat, limiting the effectiveness and the percentages … He has to improve his pull-up jumper, working on his shot selection and his midrange game where currently he is struggling the most … He has to improve the use of screens in P&R situations, especially to create the space for the shot … For a 6-7 guard he could be a better rebounder, with an average of 3 rebounds per game thus far … Defensively his limited lateral speed makes him struggle while guarding smaller and quicker opponents, especially in ISO situations … Attitude and short temper are still one of his biggest shortcomings, he struggles in managing himself during stressful situations, often arguing with referees and opponents … This could be considered the other side of his strong, emotional personality.Despite the “Space Jam” statistics he is putting up at the 2013 Eurobasket, the biggest dark cloud surrounding his NBA future is the mechanics of his shooting … The little hitch (pause) before his release has had a terrible effect on his shooting percentages over the last year … But on the bright side, this kid is highly competitive and is aware of it, so for certain he will work on it … Lack of consistency and confidence in his shot creates a lot of problems for him. He uses screens mainly to create an advantage to attack the basket, instead of shooting … In the same way he uses pick and roll, mostly hoping the defense will switch to take advantage of that … He will also struggle in the league because of his lack of athleticism and explosiveness; most of his game right now is based on overpowering defenders generally smaller or slower than him … In the NBA he will face players just as strong that are faster and more athletic. So continuing to develop his shooting and scoring ability will be key … Two other aspects remain very concerning for NBA scouts: His shots selection and his attitude … As we discussed his “overconfidence” leads to sometimes making bad choices on offense and though he seems to be very mature, I would expect him to impact the game in more ways than just scoring … 2.5 rebounds are too small of a number for a 6’7 player who is playing in an Italian national team with only two bigs and not any outstanding athletes … His attitude, which was a major red flag in the past, seems to have turned the corner in recent months, and being a leadership position will be absolutely beneficial for him under this aspect. One last question that must be asked is how strong his desire is to play in the NBA. Would he prefer to be a superstar in Italy, or a role player in the NBA? He lacks the eye of the tiger …His body language sometimes is hard to bear, and has gained the reputation of having a bad attitude, but he’s improving … He lacks consistency during games and often becomes too 3 point happy … He must improve his confidence at the free throw line where he is strangely inconsistent …",,"Son of Ferdinando Gentile, one of the best Italian players ever, he was nurtured in fertile context from the basketball standpoint, including his father’s teammates and coaches, like Bogdan Tanjevic … He grew up with Benetton Treviso youth teams, and then he moved to Milan during 2011/2012 season … His style of game is sort of a European Melo … With his combination of skills and physical strength he could become one of the most dominant players in Europe for at least the next 10 years, if he’ll be able to control his temper and develop a winning attitude … In order to translate his game at the NBA level he should invest time in individual workouts with personal trainers and shooting specialists … He’s averaging 11 points 3.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists thus far in Italian first division …Alessandro is the son of Nando Gentile, point guard of Italian national team during the 90s."," Gentile represents one of the most intriguing European talents of his generation.

Doesn’t shy away from contact … Moves very well at his height and has good versatility … Good motor and activity level … Has shown great progression as a jump shooter, even with ability to pullup off the dribble.

Needs work when he can’t dunk it over the defense and finishing contested layups, especially with his left hand. Doesn’t create much in the half court, generally just straight-line slashes to the basket … Can add a floater and midrange game to his offense. He tends to leave his feet without a plan to throw up an off-balanced shot … Perimeter offensive game has room to improve … Jump shot has shown improvement but is still a work in progress, as well as shot selection. Hunts for his shots and predetermines when he’s going to come down and shoot, rather than feel out the situation. Will take a defensive rebound to the other end to force up an ill-advised shot without making a pass. Settles for contested shots. Has made improvement as a 3PT shooter but some of his shooting numbers going into his senior year include shooting 22.2% 3P% over the Under Armour Association in 2018. Shot 6.7% 3P% (1-15) at the NBPA Top 100 in 2018 … Leans forward on free throws and seems off-balanced. Only shot 53.7% FT% over the Under Armour Association in 2018. Shot 60.6% FT% at the NBPA Top 100 in 2018 … Decision making with the ball can improve as well as cutting down on turnovers. Can be more willing as a passer but can also be very loose/wild with his passing. Averaged 2.9 turnovers per game over the Under Armour Association in 2018 … Older for an incoming freshman, will turn 20 in September of his freshman year of college …Jumpshot has shown improvement but needs more consistency … Needs to add creativity to his dribble, lacks technique when his path gets cut off and can’t dunk it over the defense. Doesn’t create much in the half court and can get more action playing off the ball … Can add a floater and midrange game to his offense … Perimeter offensive game has much room to improve.

1628371,Jonathan Isaac,2017,1,6,6,Draft,1610612753,Orlando,Magic,ORL,Florida State,College/University,1,Jonathan,Isaac,,,90.0,Rashard Lewis/Kevin Durant,"A ""tantalizing"" prospect, Isaac has a rare combination of size, length, and fluidity for wing player, in many ways similar to Kevin Durant at the same age from a physical and skill standpoint; at 6’10.5” with a 9’0.5” standing reach … He has the size to play the four (and possibly even 5) when necessary and be a presence inside once his frame fills out, but he also runs the floor like a natural wing player … Isaac has long strides, is light on his feet, and can get up and down the floor in a hurry … He has uncommon quickness for a player his size, which he utilizes very well when cutting off the ball to lose his man and create easy looks … Isaac is a quick jumper and shows good vertical explosion, particularly off of two feet when he has momentum to the basket … His length and athleticism also point towards potential as a rebounder … He showed flashes on the glass regularly at Florida State, averaging 9.6 rebounds per 40 minutes, and should develop into an even more potent rebounder as he matures … On the perimeter, he can be a mismatch, as his size and length give him the ability to get his shot off over just about any wing defender … Isaac’s jumper looks promising and should become even more dangerous with time and repetition … He is not going to be a 40-plus percent shooter from three-point land right away, but he has clearly established himself as a threat from outside (1.7 made threes per 40 minutes) with the ability to make tough pull-ups and fadeaways … Isaac is also a sound ball-handler and despite not having carte blanche at Florida State, he has shown the ability to create his own shot with a variety of moves … His ability to pull up off the dribble is extremely intiguing … He utilizes hesitations, crossovers and step backs with crisp footwork to blow by or separate into a jump shot … These flashes of shot creation at his size fuel his scoring potential and drive his potential through the roof … He does not have the most advanced feel for the game yet, but he also shows flashes as a facilitator … As a shooter he is a bit streaky but shows good shot preparation and balance with a high release … He has excellent slashing ability as well and does a great job attacking closeouts with long strides … Isaac also has a quick first step and a strong rip through move that gives him good momentum when driving to the basket … However, he is more than just a straight-line driver; he does a great job of changing speeds and directions with a variety of dribble moves, and he has excellent hip mobility … He can also shoot over the top of smaller defenders while posting up with his size and length … His size also helps him as a passer, as he can see over the top of most defenders; and has good vision … The potential for Isaac as a defensive stopper is also very intriguing … He has the tools to eventually become a player that can lock down multiple positions … He moves laterally quite well and should become a valuable switchman off the pick and roll … He has the agility and foot speed to contain smaller players on the perimeter but also has the size and reach to give bigger players a hard time down low … He is not ready to play down low regularly, but he is long and agile enough to provide glimpses of rim protection when needed to play the 4 …  He is a late bloomer that was a 6’3” guard in high school and is just scratching the surface of his abilities … Players with his combination of size, length, fluidity, and skill are extremely rare, and he will be a great fit in today’s NBA … If he can put it all together, he will be a star … Isaac’s overall upside is off the charts and may be higher than any player in this draft, and in the right situation he may ultimately end up the best player …6’10 versatile forward … Great size and length for the perimeter. Good athleticism. Very fluid and coordinated … Runs the floor like a guard and has great mobility … Good ball handling ability, can create off the dribble … Smooth shooting stroke with proper shot rotation, good from midrange and can extend to the three point line … Shoots well off the catch as well as off the dribble. Can score off of step backs and fade aways … Can put the ball on the floor and get to the rim … Can score inside and out … Good defensive ability and versatility … Moves his feet well laterally … Goes hard for loose balls and rebounds … Solid passing ability and court vision … Hit a six inch growth spurt and is a very late bloomer … Still learning the game and has great long term potential …","Isaac still has not grown into his own body yet, and is very thin for his size at only 205 pounds … He has a lot of skill but has to rely on finesse a bit too often rather than physicality … He struggles on the interior as a 4 man due to a lack of strength and toughness, and he can be pushed out of his spots pretty easily on offense … For example, he lacks the core strength to get all the way to the rim against physical defenders and can get knocked off course, especially when he elevates … Isaac has a tendency to shy away from contact and often will not explode all the way to the rim even when he has his man beat … On the interior he struggles to hold his position when posting up and will settle for fall away jumpers rather than getting to the basket … Though he has potential on defense, he allows himself to be screened easily and lacks the physicality to fight through screens … He also lacks the strength to guard the post with consistency, which limits his ability to play the four regularly … His lack of strength also affects him on the glass, where he can get bullied often and pushed out of position … He also does not always box out and relies too much on his length to track down misses … He still needs to become a more consistent shooter to become a truly reliable threat from the outside, and he is not a great ball handler under pressure … He has a tendency to settle for tough jumpers even when he has an open lane … He does not always read and react to the defense well and can waste dribbles without covering any ground … He may be best suited as a mismatch four man at the next level rather than a pure wing player, as he has a solid handle but does not always get somewhere with the dribble … He needs to become stronger with the ball as well … Isaac has good vision with the potential to become a solid playmaker, but right now his timing and accuracy are not great, and he can put his teammates in bad spots at times … He can also improve his discipline on the defensive end … He will bite on too many fakes on the perimeter and takes poor angles on the ball … He gets lost off the ball too often and needs to do a better job of seeing his man and the ball simultaneously … Isaac has loads of talent, but he has a bad habit of disappearing for stretches, especially after a bad play or two … He can improve his ability to move on to the next play … He will need to learn to stay locked in and focused for the entire game to become more consistent and reach his full potential … While his ceiling is substantial, his readiness is not where some of his peers in this draft are at, giving him a bigger basement as well, and greater risk …Lacks much strength in both the lower and upper body … Has a slight frame. Shows long term potential to defend multiple positions but struggles keeping position defending the post, causing him to pick up fouls. Struggles with physical play … Improving his post-game would make him more dangerous around the basket especially when matched up with a smaller opponent … Can improve his left hand … May still be a year away from being ""ready"" to fully impact the college level …","Isaac is one of the most intriguing prospects in the nation. After growing and maintaining his coordination, he positioned himself towards the top of his class … Thanks to a breakout summer over the Nike EYBL, Isaac jumped up the ranks and will be playing for Florida State this upcoming season.","Son of Jackie Allen … Jonathan is one of six children in his family … Has one older sister (Kalilah, 24), two older brothers (Jacob, 21 and Joel, 20) and two younger brothers (Winston, 17 and Jeremiah, 7)… His biggest influences are his Mom, his coaches and his faith … Favorite NBA player is Kevin Durant … A native of the Bronx in New York City … Selected Florida State over Kentucky, Kansas, North Carolina, Duke, Louisville, Wisconsin, Miami, Wake Forest, Stanford and LSU … Earned All-ACC Honorable Mention and All-ACC Freshman Team honors…Named the ACC Rookie of the Week twice … Many scouts feel he compares favorably to 2016 #2 overall pick Brandon Ingram … Notes: Measured 6’10’’ in shoes, with a 7’0’’ wingspan and 185 lbs at the 2015 Nike

The only young 6-10 Italian prospect that can play as pure small forward and not only under the basket as power forward or center… He has a well built body with excellent athletic skills. On the offensive side he prefers going one-on-one and can score in many ways: shooting from outside, finishing a fast-break or on low-post moves. He’s even adept at beating his defender off the dribble due to his great ball-handling skills including dribbling through his legs and behind the back. He runs the court very well with good speed and quickness despite his size. Has soft hands to shoot from three or from the mid range, that’s his best quality. Free throw shooting is another strength. Under the basket he is not so tough, but has nice moves. On the defensive side, he has good fundamentals and likes to block shots and has excellent timing. He’s also a hard worker and coachable.","Needs to develop more body strength for the NBA, as he can be moved off the block. His strength has really gotten better in the past year, but he still has aways to go… Still very new to the game having played at the professional level for only two seasons … Missed parts of the 2004-05 season due to illnesses … Excellent shot mechanics, but could use more arc on his shot … Favors his right hand, and needs to be a better back to basket offensive player … Indecisive passer at times, but employs proper tecnique … With no Italian players in the NBA, it could hurt him slightly in scouts minds … Emotional player, he needs more experience in order to gain more confidence. Like many European kids he needs to increase his body strength and add some muscles. Has to improve his rebounding skills and defense on small forwards at times. Mentally he still needs to progress. Has a tendency to rely on his jumper too much and not take the ball to basket as often as a 6-10 player should. Born in 1985, so he’s still learning the game and has very little experience at a ahigh level, but Benetton Treviso is the right team for Andrea to become a great player.

Transformed himself from a 6-5 PF as a HS frehsman into a legit wing player with the ability to create for himself and others off the dribble at the wing position …The first two things that jump out are his incredible football player like body and his competitiveness … He’s a standout with his on ball defense where he is able to use his huge chest to muscle any offensive threat … But compared to Ron Artest, he looks like a much better defender off the ball, using his large wingspan to deflect passes and his big hands to snatch the ball away from opposing players … Defensively, he’s absolutely a beast, who could immediate play in the NBA creating problems for many NBA wings … Perhaps another of his best characteristics, really rare in a 18 year old is how he plays to his strengths, never takes a bad shots, never tries to show off, instead takes what the game gives him … He uses his big shoulders to get into the lane and finish with contact; underrated athlete off one foot, and he doesn’t have any problems finishing with both hands around the rim … He’s a very good ball handler for a player his size … He was a four until his HS junior year. He can also help the guards bringing the ball up and has strong IQ and good decision making … Intangibles are where he separates himself from the herd, a sharp, focused kid who understand his role and wants to win, which is what everybody looks for in the league … Doesn’t have the length of Leonard or his offensive skills, but the right attitude will help him have a better career than more talented players …","A little inconsistent on both ends of the floor this past season … Needs to improve his ability to directly finish as the rim … Better leaper off of two feet than one. Not incredibly explosive, just solid leaping ability … Has nice touch overall, but not against length … Doesn’t go up as strong versus longer players … Does not finish as well against contact as his strength may make you think … Is often out of control when driving to the rim … Sometimes settles for floaters too often … Needs to prove he can make his teammates better … Struggles with making decisions (setting up teammates) when he’s attacking the basket in transition … Sometimes has tunnel vision when he’s on the move on offense and does not look to pass to his teammates … Missed a lot of open teammates … Not an accurate passer … Needs to develop his left hand more (finishing and ball-handling) … Often relies too much on overpowering and going through defenders on the dribble drive … Forgets about his teammates at times because he tries to prove himself as a scorer … Play more below the rim in half court settings … Struggles at times to create for himself against quick defenders … Fails to create separation in isolation situations … Gets too caught up in creating contact that it takes his focus off getting to the rim and finishing … This also gets him called for a lot of charges … Struggled with shot selection … Tends to push the ball even when there’s no numbers … Needs to pick his spots better … Forces bad shots in the paint against multiple defenders … Short arms his shots … Streaky shooter … Needs to develop a more consistent jumper from mid-range and the 3-point line … Jump shot has a flat/low release … Shoots contested jumpers early in the clock … A little turnover prone … Effort level on defense fluctuates at times … Needs to be consistently locked in on defense instead of just in flashes (has lapses) … Although he can recover well, he gets beat off the dribble from the perimeter … Either loses his man or overhelps … Gets caught ball watching … Slow in his recognition of screens at times … Lets his aggressiveness get the best of him … Good rebounder but sometimes fails to put his body on a man and box out …The offensive side has to become better for him to become an impact player on both ends … his biggest issue right now is his jump shot … Not that he doesn’t score, he actually shoots pretty well for his form … The problem is that right now his shot is very flat and the release point is in front of the face which doesn’t allow him to be consistent, particular when tired or under pressure from a contest … In high school, many players contesting his shot are smaller than him, but in the league he will go against elite athletes that will obscure his vision … Just a small change rising his release point 6-12 inches will have a great impact on his percentages … Definitely something they will work with him on at Arizona next year … Becoming a reliable 3 point shooter could make the difference in his career … My other big concern is that he could have a Trevor Ariza kind of moment, deciding to be the best or second best player in the team where he will struggle a lot … As long as he stays in his role (3rd or 4th option and dirty work) he can be absolutely be among the best at it … His athleticism is cause of concern because he really struggles jumping off of two feet (needing momentum)  and this really hurts him on rebounds where he has to work twice as hard … Despite those weakness I really believe Stanley intangibles will give him a chance to be a valuable NBA contributor …","DJ Khalid’s “All I do is Win” would be the perfect theme song for Stanley’s young basketball career  … Never has a player in California history been able to have the impact that he had in the High School world, winning four state championships in four years and becoming a living legend in California’s high school system … But if you are looking for fancy passes, ankle breaking cross-overs and And-1 moves you’d likely be disappointed in watching Stanley … 6’7 with a 6’11 wingspan, Johnson has a great body for a kid of his age, and he is not afraid to use it … Does not have a big vertical athlete by any means, particularly off two feet, but being more than 240 pounds of muscles and strength makes him a nightmare for any offensive player trying to go by him. It’s obvious Stanley will one day be a good NBA player, maybe never an NBA All-Star, but the 3rd/4th best player in a contending team. The perfect piece for many teams who love to have a player of his quality put the team in front of personal needs …","Johnson turned in standout freshman season for the Arizona Wildcats with averages of 13.8 points and 6.8 rebounds per game … His shooting efficiency improved throughout the season, finishing as a 44 percent shooter from the field, including 37 percent from the 3-point line … He played an integral role for Wildcats team that went 34-4 and reached the Elite 8 for the second consecutive year … Standing at 6-foot-7, 245 pounds, he’s not a typical 18-year-old freshman … He has great athleticism, an NBA ready body, chiseled frame, and often looks like a man among boys … The California native is relentless attacking the basket, especially in transition where he has no issue with throwing down powerful highlight dunks on a nightly basis … Johnson still has a few things to ""shore up"", such as his shooting, slowing down his pace at the right times and creating for his

while elevating the program…It did not go that way, and Baldwin Jr and UW-Milwaukee both struggled to win or produce quality numbers, and it led to the dismissal of Pat Baldwin Sr being fired and subsequently Baldwin Jr entering the transfer portal after just 11 games….It was a poor fit, as it seemed Baldwin Jr wasn’t quite ready for the attention or responsibility of being the alpha on a team with a lack of shot creation…There is chatter that his poor season can largely be attributed to the ankle injury from HS that maybe still hasn’t healed properly, and the missed games dealing with COVID affected his rhythm and attrition as the season wore on…But on the surface as a prospect he does offer nice size/length as a combo forward and the base of a promising shooting stroke that could be a useful floor spacing tool with more confidence and the right playmaking around him…He will have to prove he can defend his position(s) at the NBA level and continue to polish his overall game to show that his year in college was a fluke…His stock has taken a hit and is all over the place after coming into the season as a projected lottery selection, and his injury history will be paid close attention to, but he could hear his name called as early as the late 1st round based on perceived upside as a former ballyhooed recruit or he could slide and be picked by a team will to take a flyer

201565,Derrick Rose,2008,1,1,1,Draft,1610612741,Chicago,Bulls,CHI,Memphis,College/University,1,Derrick,Rose,,,104.0,Dwyane Wade/Jason Kidd," A breath taking athlete with terrific size for the point guard position at 6-3 … His upside is truly special … An absolutely dazzling dunker with blinding speed … Likely to be the most athletic PG in the league for years to come … A point guard in the truest sense of the word. His development in this area has been phenomenal in the past 2 years (which is apparent when you read his profile from a year and a half ago) … Knows how to run a team, and raises the level of play of his teammates … A pass-first point guard with excellent court vision … Has a rare ability to create passing lanes, finding and creating shots for teammates who do not appear to be open … A relentless defender with quick hands and length. Gets low and will lock his man down on defense and should only improve. Gives the same intensity and effort on both ends of the floor Excellent handle on the ball, with a deadly crossover, very tough to contain one on one … A constant threat to blow by his man off the dribble … Rarely shows much emotion, very calm on and off-court demeanor, does not get rattled easily … Plays with a high level of intensity remaining level-headed … Deadly on the fast break with his passing ability and athleticism … Powerful leaper. Can get his head at rim level and has the strength to go into traffic and dunk on people Catlike quickness and body control … Excellent finisher around the basket even after contact Clutch player who raises his level of play against good competition and wants the ball in crunch time … Hits his foul shots at a good rate … Very team-oriented with a great attitude. Willing to learn, very coachable and still improving … Accustomed to the ‘family feeling’ with his teams (he is very close with his high school teammates, and his AAU team, coached by his brother, consisting mostly of his high school teammates). Has a close knit group surrounding him and protecting his future … Tough as nails competitor. A warrior who leaves it out on the floor every time out … A true floor general who shows a solid understanding of the game. Good decision maker. Has very long arms and strong hands … Loves to drive and hang in the air and shoot when hes cleared the defense … Very crafty at making shots around the basket, especially fadeways getting great height on his jumpers … Excellent rebounder due to his size, strength and tenacityWeaknesses: Mechanics on his shot are not fluid, so he may need to adjust it some as he sort of slings the ball from his shoulder, though his shot has shown steady improvement … A streaky shooter, can go through cold spells … More effective in an up-tempo game, understands tempo but his speed obviously makes running logical and is still less effective in the half court … Underdeveloped moves off the dribble. He can become more polished creating shots from the perimeter (à la OJ Mayo) … Right now relies almost exclusively on his power, handle, and quickness to get by defenders … Can become a lot better at running the pick and roll … Has the size to post up PGs all day. He shows great strength and intensity inside but has underutilized back to the basket skills … Sometimes appears to be coasting during games, though I believe this is when he is getting a feel for the tempo of the game, and he is reluctant to force things … Not much of a vocal leader, but certainly leads by example. And this is sure to develop with maturity … A year or two in college will do wonders for his grasp of the point guard position. Easily the toughest to master on the NBA level … Had a tendency to rely too much on his athleticism early in his high school career, but has developed other facets of his game …Notes: With his package of size, speed and talent hes got a legitimate shot to go first overall, which is unusual for a point guard …Frank Rusnak – 8/9/2005 Strengths: An extraordinary athlete, there are few as athletic as him. Extremely quick hands, feet and fast in the open court … He simply takes the air out of a gym when he goes into action whether it is taking off for a highlight-reel dunk or knifing through the passing lanes to pick off an unsuspecting point guards entry pass to the wing … He rises high on his solid jumper which extends to the three-point line … He has very good ball handling ability … A great kid. Derrick is the antithesis to many of the prima donnas of this day and age. A quiet-natured individual, he carries himself with a proud dignity on the court but rarely shows emotions.","Mechanics on his shot are not fluid, so he may need to adjust it some as he sort of slings the ball from his shoulder, though his shot has shown steady improvement … A streaky shooter, can go through cold spells … More effective in an up-tempo game, understands tempo but his speed obviously makes running logical and is still less effective in the half court … Underdeveloped moves off the dribble.

Easily the toughest to master on the NBA level … Had a tendency to rely too much on his athleticism early in his high school career, but has developed other facets of his game …Right now he is just too valuable as a scorer to be his team’s PG, but he’ll need to work on becoming more of a PG to optimize his potential on the NBA level. But he does play PG occasionally for Simeon and when he does it’s more of just the guy who brings it up, sets up the offense and kicks it over to the wing; rarely do I see him wheeling and dealing, getting in the paint and creating for his teammates. Now he does do that occasionally, but not as much as a typical top-level PG. So making his teammates better is probably the biggest area he needs to improve upon … At times his quiet demeanor could almost be confused for timidness on the court. Although he is a remarkable individual when he asserts himself, there are times when he blends into the flow of the game and doesnt exhibit his dominance as much as he could.",,"With his package of size, speed and talent hes got a legitimate shot to go first overall, which is unusual for a point guard …",,yes,18.1,0.098,18.3,breath taking athlete terrific size point guard position 63 upside truly special absolutely dazzling dunker blinding speed likely athletic pg league year come point guard truest sense word development area phenomenal past 2 year apparent read profile year half ago know run team raise level play teammate passfirst point guard excellent court vision rare ability create passing lane finding creating shot teammate appear open relentless defender quick hand length get low lock man defense improve give intensity effort end floor excellent handle ball deadly crossover tough contain one one constant threat blow man dribble rarely show much emotion calm offcourt demeanor get rattled easily play high level intensity remaining levelheaded deadly fast break passing ability athleticism powerful leaper get head rim level strength go traffic dunk people catlike quickness body control excellent finisher around basket even contact clutch player raise level play good competition want ball crunch time hit foul shot good rate teamoriented great attitude willing learn coachable still improving accustomed family feeling team close high school teammate aau team coached brother consisting mostly high school teammate close knit group surrounding protecting future tough nail competitor warrior leaf floor every time true floor general show solid understanding game good decision maker long arm strong hand love drive hang air shoot he cleared defense crafty making shot around basket especially fadeways getting great height jumper excellent rebounder due size strength tenacityweaknesses mechanic shot fluid may need adjust sort sling ball shoulder though shot shown steady improvement streaky shooter go cold spell effective uptempo game understands tempo speed obviously make running logical still le effective half court underdeveloped move dribble become polished creating shot perimeter à la oj mayo right relies almost exclusively power handle quickness get defender become lot better running pick roll size post pgs day show great strength intensity inside underutilized back basket skill sometimes appears coasting game though believe getting feel tempo game reluctant force thing much vocal leader certainly lead example sure develop maturity year two college wonder grasp point guard position easily toughest master nba level tendency rely much athleticism early high school career developed facet game note package size speed talent he got legitimate shot go first overall unusual point guard frank rusnak 892005 strength extraordinary athlete athletic extremely quick hand foot fast open court simply take air gym go action whether taking highlightreel dunk knifing passing lane pick unsuspecting point guard entry pas wing rise high solid jumper extends threepoint line good ball handling ability great kid derrick antithesis many prima donna day age quietnatured individual carry proud dignity court rarely show emotion,mechanic shot fluid may need adjust sort sling ball shoulder though shot shown steady improvement streaky shooter go cold spell effective uptempo game understands tempo speed obviously make running logical still le effective half court underdeveloped move dribble become polished creating shot perimeter à la oj mayo right relies almost exclusively power handle quickness get defender become lot better running pick roll size post pgs day show great strength intensity inside underutilized back basket skill sometimes appears coasting game though believe getting feel tempo game reluctant force thing much vocal leader certainly lead example sure develop maturity year two college wonder grasp point guard position easily toughest master nba level tendency rely much athleticism early high school career developed facet game right valuable scorer team pg hell need work becoming pg optimize potential nba level play pg occasionally simeon guy brings set offense kick wing rarely see wheeling dealing getting paint creating teammate occasionally much typical toplevel pg making teammate better probably biggest area need improve upon time quiet demeanor could almost confused timidness court although remarkable individual asserts time blend flow game doesnt exhibit dominance much could,,56.19509044,1.0,56.19509044,1.201809601,N,N,MID,N,0.9874,1

His senior year, he improved to 48% from the field on over 17 shots a game, 39% from 3-point range, and 82% from the free throw line. Was a highly efficient player on a high volume of attempts … … An extremely quick and crafty player that pushes the ball in transition attacking the rim, which is when he is at his best … A tremendous 1 on 1 player with a bevy of moves at his disposal … Is comfortable spotting up or shooting off the dribble with solid shooting form. Shows good movement without the ball and uses screens efficiently. Has improved as a passer in his 4 year career, averaging almost 4 his senior year on a solid assist to turnover ratio. Is especially good at finding the open man off of the pick and roll … VT Coach James Johnson is a huge fan of Green’s work ethic and notes his ability to makes smart decisions on the floor.","A combo ""tweener"" as Green shows much better scoring ability than facilitating and lacks ideal size at the 2 … Only 180-185 pounds with little strength. Will definitely need to get stronger if he wants to keep bigger guards out of the lane and get himself into the paint on offense … Bigger defenders can body Green rather easily and knock him off balance when penetrating … Is a below average finisher with contact and will need to improve his floater to be effective at the next level … There are questions about whether Green will be able to guard any position in the NBA … Will need to keep up his improvement as a passer because he will likely be forced to play some point guard. Although very quick, Green does not possess great jumping ability so will have to learn how to score around bigger and more athletic defenders … Seemed to focus more of his energy on offense this year opposed to defense, leading to less effective numbers on a per minute basis … Green has shown the ability to be effective when having the green light at all times offensively, but how much being relegated to a secondary role will affect his efficency remains to be seen …",,"Led the entire nation in scoring, averaging 25.0 ppg for Virginia Tech as a Senior … Measured 6’2.5 (in shoes) 180 lbs, with a 6’6.5 wingspan at the 2012 Deron Williams Skills Academy",,yes,9.3,0.011,-0.2,green exploded onto scene senior year becoming leading scorer college basketball going 2nd round prospect likely first round prospect 64 185 pound green average size nba shooting guard good length impressive green improved efficiency drastically year 4year career coming bench freshman year shot 29 floor 275 3 point range 68 line senior year improved 48 field 17 shot game 39 3point range 82 free throw line highly efficient player high volume attempt extremely quick crafty player push ball transition attacking rim best tremendous 1 1 player bevy move disposal comfortable spotting shooting dribble solid shooting form show good movement without ball us screen efficiently improved passer 4 year career averaging almost 4 senior year solid assist turnover ratio especially good finding open man pick roll vt coach james johnson huge fan green work ethic note ability make smart decision floor,combo tweener green show much better scoring ability facilitating lack ideal size 2 180185 pound little strength definitely need get stronger want keep bigger guard lane get paint offense bigger defender body green rather easily knock balance penetrating average finisher contact need improve floater effective next level question whether green able guard position nba need keep improvement passer likely forced play point guard although quick green posse great jumping ability learn score around bigger athletic defender seemed focus energy offense year opposed defense leading le effective number per minute basis green shown ability effective green light time offensively much relegated secondary role affect efficency remains seen,,11.89508197,3.25,38.65901639,-0.214741146,Y,Y,Y,Y,0.9874,1

wants to be great … Even in high school, practiced with the focus of a pro … Has been a winner every step of the way of his career; won four straight Illinois State Titles in high school … Can create for teammates thanks to his high basketball IQ and overall play making ability … Commands so much attention from opposing defenses that teammates will find themselves with more opportunities to receive the ball in a position to score with him on the floor …  Can finish with both hands around the hoop … Solid, but not great ability to knock down the NBA 3-ball … Had some impressive dunks in his freshman season at Duke, which proved that he does possess the hops and explosiveness that he often does not get credit for … Also showed surprising body control and ball handling, weaving through defenders for finishes at the rim in the open floor …First and foremost, Parker is already a good physical specimen for either forward position, and has just about all of the size he’ll need to be an NBA wing at nearly 6’9 240 … Plays strong, and has more than adequate length … Very fluid with good athleticism, showing exceptional body control and pretty good speed and leaping ability … More explosive than he appears at 1st glance … Lived up to his lofty expectations after a highly touted HS career … Already has a great arsenal of moves in his repertoire on offense … Has an NBA ready step back jumper and is tough for most matchups to pressure as a ball-handler … Is a threat to slash in either direction … Is able to shoot or drive effectively from the triple threat … Puts the ball on the floor, can score with his feet set, and shows good confidence as a scorer … Mid-range game is pretty polished … Great 1st step, and when operating facing the basket this is where the Carmelo Anthony comparisons are most evident … Not overly aggressive, and generally plays well off his instincts … Has shown the ability to pull down a defensive rebound and go coast to coast for either a finish at the rim or go to the line … Good finisher, and has the ability to finish above the rim with power around trees … Does a good job drawing contact, and is not at all prone to shying away from physical play … Is a long strider, and can change directions well for his size as a ball-handler … Looks like he has the necessary tools to develop into a primary scorer at the next level, and the mentality to handle that responsibility … Has some natural shot-making ability that all of the high level NBA scorers possess, and has shown he can really light up the scoreboard in bunches … Has a nice post game for a guy that is being projected to be primarily a wing player … Has good footwork and already understands how to get a wide base to take advantage of smaller defenders … Quick feet, and gets angles on defenses when operating around the hoop … His turnaround jumper is strong … Makes an impact on the glass, and was a terrific offensive rebounder last season at Duke … Aware of his surroundings, and doesn’t get caught falling asleep much when shots goes up on either end … Pretty smart, and can make plays on both ends by using his physical tools and his instincts … Makes timely steals and blocks, and is always to be accounted for on offense because of his ability to make intriguing momentum-shifting plays … Can’t really be considered a selfish player, does look to get teammates involved when he draws extra attention … Seems to be by all accounts a high character person, and a very focused competitor who has strong leadership potential … Comes off a guy who likes to lead by example, but is fairly vocal too even when he isn’t having his best game … His ability to contribute at the level he did on a talented roster and elite level program like Duke as a true Fr. is definitely extremely encouraging, and he won’t turn 20 until late in his rookie season … Has the ability to play some PF too, and his versatility as a scorer with his size makes him a big mismatch at the next level … Plenty of ability to get better, a scary proposition for a guy with his skills …Ultra-skilled forward with an innate, natural ability to play basketball … Remarkably advanced basketball IQ for a player his age … Already possesses many of the intangible qualities that NBA teams covet … Strong competitor that plays hard on both ends of the floor. Rarely fails to ""show up"" for games … Moves around the court well with or without the ball … Good overall shot-selection … Hard worker, who appears to respect the game … Has good size for a small forward (measured recently at 6’8.5"" in shoes), and still has some time to grow … Appears to have a wingspan of 7’0"" or close to it … He makes up for his lack of elite athleticism by being an aggressive athlete that takes advantage of any opportunities the defense gives to him … Has shown the ability to rise up and emphatically dunk over the top of the defense … Footspeed is fairly average, but he’s still a very fluid runner, particularly in the open court … Knows how to take advantage of ""sleeping"" defenders, showing great activity off the ball with an understanding of back-cuts and spotting-up from the corner … Is a pure shooter that displays a soft touch out to the NBA three-point line … Has the size, touch and footwork to become a very capable player in the post, which would make him a big-time mismatch threat from the wing position … Capable in the mid-range with a rapidly improving pull-up jumper that is already extremely difficult to defend … Dangerous when taking players off the dribble … Uses hesitations, fakes and crossovers to throw his defender off balance … Combines a refined offensive awareness with an unselfish nature to always find his teammates when they are open … Solid defender that works hard to bother his man … Has the length and instincts to make an impact on the glass as well … High-character player and a member of the LDS church … Still very young and has a lot of room to improve … Likely the top high school player in the country and has superstar potential …","Defense and position are the two biggest questions with Parker … Some wonder whether he is quick enough to guard on the perimeter, or if he is long enough to defend the post … Has been given the ""tweener"" label that no draft prospect wants associated with his name … Appears to carry some extra ""baby fat"" … Somewhat slow release on the jumper, and it has a hitch; may need to tweak release to improve scoring opportunities against athletic defenders who match his size … Can he expand his range to be a reliable 3-point shooter? … Was asked to play in the post defensively for Duke, which may lead to an even bigger learning curve for Parker as he improves his understanding of how to guard wings in the NBA … Not a particularly crafty defender; surprising given how intelligent an offensive player he is …Defense is the area of his game that has drawn the greatest amount of criticism. Does not exhibit the same level of intensity and effort on that end, and how much of that was due to playing center or staying out of foul trouble is open to debate … Given his size, there are some concerns about him being in between the SF and PF positions at the next level … Also, will need to find a weight that will allow him to maximize his athleticism … Not really a defined or “tight-skinned” specimen physically, and probably carried slightly more weight than he should’ve last season … Appears to be a guy that will always have to work a little harder to keep his weight in check, and his body toned. And any extended injuries could cause him more trouble weight wise than the average prospect. But he seems up to the task … Not a sharp team defender yet, and still needs to improve his knowledge of where to be on this side of the ball … Makes fundamental errors, and can look lost when defending the pick and roll game, and was at times exposed for this against quality opponents who spaced the floor on offense last season … Needs to work on improving his lateral speed and defensive technique … Effort overall on defense needs improvement as well … Sometimes settles for more difficult looks than he should, and doesn’t always look to get to the rim as much as he should … Can make tough shots, but does shoot more contested jumpers than he has to … Sometimes tries to be too aggressive, especially when his team was trailing … Not quite an overly explosive athlete, and can struggle at times to finish above taller defenders when he can’t get a clean drive past the initial defense … Has high level talent, but needs to polish his skills and do a better job with his shot selection to really reach his potential as a player …While Parker is a good all-around athlete, he won’t be much of a stand-out as far as the NBA is concerned … His first-step lacks the explosion of some of the other elite-level prospects he’s often compared to, and he won’t be labeled by many as a ""high flyer"" either … If he works hard on his strength and conditioning, he should be able to maximize his potential athletically as he grows into his height, but even for a player with a reputation like Parker, this is still an “if” … Parker’s outside shot can be inconsistent, though at only 16 years of age, this is a common issue, and can be rectified with practice and experience … He’s drawn comparisons to players like Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony, and those kinds of expectations can weigh heavily on younger players …",,"A Mormon, and has not yet done a Mormon mission … Had considered delaying his college career to do the mission, but obviously opted to play ball … Some conspiracy theorists wonder if he gets drafted by a team that he does not want to play for, whether he threatens to hold out on signing a contract and instead go on a mission. But this is definitely more speculative than a likely scenario at this point … Did not participate in the 2014 Draft Combine, given that he is already a consensus top 3 pick … Is an elite talent, and has been considered as such since his early high-school days … USBWA National Freshman of the Year award winner for his stellar 2013-14 campaign as a Duke Blue Devil … Had a successful freshman season at Duke, although the team disappointed in the NCAA Tournament, losing to 14 seed Mercer in the first round …Measured 6’8.5 (in shoes) 222 lbs, with a 6’11 wingspan at the 2011 LeBron James Skills Academy … Measured 6’8 (in shoes) 241 lbs, with a 7’0 wingspan and 8’8 reach at the 2013 Nike Hoop Summit … Measured 6’8.5 (in shoes) 240 lbs, with a 6’11.5 wingspan at the 2013 Kevin Durant Skills Academy"," Parker is considered by most as a wing prospect but may actually project even stronger as a stretch 4 … Parker had an outstanding Freshman season at Duke, and really has some of the best skills of any prospect in this draft … He is a fantastic talent on the offensive side of the ball with the kind of mentality needed to be a franchise player at the next level … Has the potentially to be a more well rounded Melo and without any of the negative selfishness or lack of team focus that Melo has long been criiticized for … His game and leadership should allow him to make an impact at the next level the second he takes the floor, and he already has the physical tools of an NBA player despite his youth … Seems like the type of person and competitor that any organization would want, and is extremely mature by all accounts … Can play either forward position effectively, and will be a tough matchup on a nightly basis at the next level … He will need to improve his defensive skills and his overall awareness, but he has strong instincts and the smarts to continue to improve … Parker is a virtual lock to be a top 3 selection in the 2014 NBA Draft …Jorrye Nixon

Vision and playmaking skills seem to be developing nicely … In the Hoop Summit he displayed a reliable handle and the ability to play under control at a high rate of speed, setting up teammates for buckets as well as an emerging pull up jumper. Granted that was against a talented but inexperienced group of high school prospects … A solid defender, showing a good understanding of spacing and staying in defensive position with his hands active without reaching. Displays a lot of potential to be an on ball pest with his quick feet and huge wingspan … Shows a developing tear drop and would be well served by perfecting it … Also has a deft spin dribble move … Schroeder’s elite level speed is his biggest weapon and gives him a lot of intrigue as an NBA prospect …","Still raw, efficiency numbers this season could have been better … His 3.3 to 2.9 a/to ratio display his need to become a more efficient ball protector and distributor. Though it is important to keep in mind that he’s still just 19 … Despite his 40% 3 point shooting numbers, his shot appears to lack the ability to extend out to NBA 3 at this point, as he shoots a bit of a set shot … Just 168 lbs. Frame is slight so getting stronger will be important. At this point he can be easily muscled and knocked off balance by bigger and stronger guards. Narrow shoulders mean he’ll likely never be a physical player … Added strength would allow him to finish after contact and better utilize his ability to get into the paint. It would also benefit him defensively if opponents attempt to post him … Needs to develop the ability to go left. He is too right hand dominant making it easier to defend him by overplaying his right … Much more effective shooting from spot up than off isolation. Gaining the ability to go left would help in this area … Lacks experience playing against a high level of competition, having played this season with a low level German team (New Yorker Phantoms) with lower level Americans and Germans, and the team struggled (13-19) … Will need to develop into a vocal leader as a lead guard … Must become more adept running the pick and roll as a ball handler … Solid athlete but not a dynamic, above the rim type of finisher …",,"Breakout star of the Portland Hoop Summit where he impressed numerous GMs and scouts … Benefited from a tremendous week of practices followed by an excellent game in which he outperformed Kasey Hill and Demetrius Jackson. putting up 18 points, 6 assists and just 3 turnovers … Game appears tailor made for the NBA as opposed to Europe due to his potential to break down opponents with his speed … Named most improved player in the BBL … There aren’t a ton of big names on his German BBL team, former Duke Blue Devil and Arizona State Sun Devil, Eric Boateng, being one …",,yes,,,,point guard effortless blow speed get opponent virtually 6162 huge wingspan 67 14 show good form shot stats back hitting 40 3 33 attempt per game 84 line averaging 119 ppg 24 mpg season german bundesliga solid passer vision playmaking skill seem developing nicely hoop summit displayed reliable handle ability play control high rate speed setting teammate bucket well emerging pull jumper granted talented inexperienced group high school prospect solid defender showing good understanding spacing staying defensive position hand active without reaching display lot potential ball pest quick foot huge wingspan show developing tear drop would well served perfecting also deft spin dribble move schroeders elite level speed biggest weapon give lot intrigue nba prospect,still raw efficiency number season could better 33 29 ato ratio display need become efficient ball protector distributor though important keep mind he still 19 despite 40 3 point shooting number shot appears lack ability extend nba 3 point shoot bit set shot 168 lb frame slight getting stronger important point easily muscled knocked balance bigger stronger guard narrow shoulder mean hell likely never physical player added strength would allow finish contact better utilize ability get paint would also benefit defensively opponent attempt post need develop ability go left right hand dominant making easier defend overplaying right much effective shooting spot isolation gaining ability go left would help area lack experience playing high level competition played season low level german team new yorker phantom lower level american german team struggled 1319 need develop vocal leader lead guard must become adept running pick roll ball handler solid athlete dynamic rim type finisher,,49.19680851,1.8,88.55425532,TBD,N,N,N,TBD,0.988,1
1630591,Jalen Suggs,2021,1,5,5,Draft,1610612753,Orlando,Magic,ORL,Gonzaga,College/University,1,Jalen,Suggs,,,99.0,Jason Kidd/DeAaron Fox,"Lead guard with great leadership, toughness and physical attributes to be a stand out on both ends at the next level … With his insane athleticism, Suggs can turn any miss into a coast-to-coast layup … He has great feel for when to attack the basket, and a strong mix of dribble moves allows him to blow past defenders … Very decisive in the open court, and has the ability to outclass many opponents with his quickness and elusiveness  but can also bully his way for easy baskets … Understands when to shoot and when to move the ball to a teammate … Tremendous shot selection with regard to the modern NBA, as almost 85% of his attempts came at the rim or behind the arc … Rarely takes mid-range shots, in part because he can so easily get to the rim … Solid finisher, with a field goal percentage of 64% around the rim … Scored 14.4 points per game, but could increase that if allowed to take over in more games, as the offense was often run through Timme … Averaged 5.6 rebounds per game, and fights well for boards … Boxes out well…His tremendous build and 6’4 height bring versatility on both ends of the court … Great versatility. While more comfortable running the offense, Suggs is capable of playing shooting guard, especially with how well he can move without the basketball and would figure to pair well with an undersized off guard … Defensively, he can play either guard spot, as his length, quickness and strength help him take on larger players … Reads the game at an elite level on both offense and defense … Particularly as a help defender, Suggs excels at understanding what the offense is running, and where to position himself in order to limit the chance of an easy bucket … Smart and decisive on when to double, help or go for steals, and is rarely caught making the wrong play defensively … Also excellent at forcing turnovers, averaging 1.9 steals per game…Is one of the most clutch players in college basketball, most notably draining a buzzer-beating three just steps past half court to defeat UCLA in the Final Four … The former five-star recruit also led the team in assists with 4.5 per game, showcasing his willingness and ability to share the ball …6’5 point guard … Creates offense and scoring opportunities for himself. Can get to the rim against a set defense and doesn’t need triple threat to beat the defense. Finished 6th in scoring with 17.8 points per game over the Under Armour Association in 2017, averaged 13.6 points per game at 47.4% FG% in 2018, and finished 2nd in scoring with 20.2 points per game at 52.5% FG% in 2019. Averaged 9.6 points per game at the U19 World Cup in 2019 … Good strength and build … Quick first step and a fearless driver. Attacks the rim with aggression and adjusts his layups in the air. Plays physical. Initiates contact and draws fouls at a high rate. Shot a 3rd most 8 free throws per game over the Under Armour Association in 2017, shot 5.3 free throws per game in 2018, and shot a 2nd most 8.1 free throws per game in 2019. Shot a reliable 79% FT% over the Under Armour Association in 2019. Shot 83.3% FT% at the U16 Americas Championship in 2017 … Good ball handler under pressure and changes directions well. Drives and handles well going left or right … Solid passing ability. Finished 6th in assists with 4.9 per game over the Under Armour Association in 2018 and a 2nd most 5.5 assists to 1.8 turnovers per game in 2019 … Consistently competes on defense. Puts pressure on the ball and jumps passing lanes very well. Averaged 2.5 steals per game over the Under Armour Association in 2017, averaged 1.7 per game in 2018, and led the league with 1.5 steals per game in 2019. Averaged a steal per game at the U16 Americas Championship in 2017. Averaged a 4th most 3.3 steals per game at the U17 World Cup in 2018. Averaged a 6th most 2.4 steals per game at the U19 World Cup in 2019 … Good rebounder for position. Averaged 6.4 rebounds per game over the Under Armour Association in 2017 and 6 per game in 2019 …","The most glaring weakness for the star freshman is his inconsistency shooting from behind the arc and at the free throw line … Shot just 33.7% from three and 76.1% from the charity stripe … While not impossible to see him becoming a reliable shooter, he has some work to do in order to become more capable, especially as shooting has become gold in the NBA … While smart defensively, Suggs can sometimes lose focus on the ball, and get beat by simple moves, like change of pace toward the basket … Because of his immense talent, it is easy to forget that Suggs was a freshman, but that certainly was exemplified by his turnovers … At almost three per game, that number needs to come down in order for him to be a truly efficient point guard …Playing at Gonazaga, Suggs played a weaker conference schedule than other top prospects… It is not his fault his team was almost always significantly more talented, but Suggs and Gonzaga were rarely challenged throughout the season … They played numerous games against top-25 teams, suffering a loss only to Baylor in the championship game, but the West Coast Conference was simply too easy for the Zags, and for Suggs … It will be a huge jump in competition for Suggs, with what was mostly an easy schedule in college …Scoring against greater length at the next levels may be an obstacle as well as consistently finding ways to score … Although form isn’t bad, he can improve as a 3PT shooter and sometimes he’s too quick with the trigger. Shot 31.6% 3PT% over the Under Armour Association in 2017, shot 30.3% 3PT% in 2018, and shot 33.3% 3PT% in 2019. Shot 30% 3PT% at the U16 Americas Championship in 2017. Shot 20% 3PT% at the U17 World Cup in 2018. Shot 25% 3PT% at the U19 World Cup in 2019 … Passing and playmaking is solid but isn’t highly advanced. High assist count but doesn’t show a lot of advanced reads or court vision.

Will he be another John “Hot Plate” Williams or Robert “Tractor” Traylor? … Lacks great mobility at his current weight, hindering his ability to play an up tempo game … And in turn would fit best with a half court oriented team at the NBA level … It remains to be seen how much quickness and mobility he can add by dropping some weight … At 6-6.5 is severely undersized at the post position although his 7-foot-3 wingspan allows him to play a few inches bigger … Doesn’t have great explosiveness either which makes creating shots against bigger and more athletic players a challenge … … At times showed his inexperience late in the year making careless mental errors in key moments … Needs to become more efficient from the line (61% FT) … Should also look to add a more consistent mid-range shot … Excess weight makes it difficult for him to face the basket and get by opponents or get to rebounds out of his position … His defensive ability is also diminished by his lack of foot speed … Extremely strong willed, which is both a positive and a negaitve. He goes to the beat of his own drum which could be a real detriment if he’s unresponsive to coaching and taking instruction …  Aran Smith 5/11/09Blair should continue to polish his one-on-one low post moves A deadly-mid range jumper would greatly benefit his game, a la Carlos Boozer or Kurt Thomas.

Granted ball skills and shooting are more important long term for point guards than athleticism (ie Curry vs Westbrook) … Struggles some to finish plays around the rim due to his lack of leg strength and explosiveness … NBA readiness and ability to contribute immediately are both concerns as he’s extremely thin, even by college standards … Assist to turnover number was underwhelming and needs to improve (3.2 to 2.6) … Additional core strength should improve his leaping ability, but also his explosiveness off the dribble … Most of Terry’s offense came in pick and roll and spot ups and he rarely created off of isolation … Becoming better at working in space on isolation will be beneficial to him …",,"Measured: 6’1.50” barefoot, 6’3.00” in shoes, 8’0.00” standing reach, 170.0 lbs, and 6’1.75” wingspan at the 2020 NBA Combine … Averaged 14.6 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 3.0 apg, connecting on 40% from three and 89% from FT as a freshman at Stanford … Surprised many with his decision to enter the 2020 NBA draft as it was assumed he is a year away, however he figures to find a spot in the first round … Considering his age, it was probably a good decision to enter considering there may not be a college season, or at best an abbreviated one, and working with an NBA team’s strength and conditioning staff for the upcoming year would be beneficial …  Native of Minneapolis, MN …"," A late bloomer physically … One of the most intriguing “projects” in this year’s draft … Despite possibly “jumping the gun” on a pro career, he has one of the highest ceilings of any point guard in this year’s draft … Pending how his body develops, he can become a stand out in the NBA … He’s a natural shooter and playmaker with shades of Stephen Curry and Trae Young to his game …",yes,6.7,-0.035,0.0,sharp shooting point guard slight frame ton upside body develops cerebral focused player great maturity mental standpoint slick advanced offensive skill set one purest shooter year draft release clean concise make look easy time get set release ball rarely miss quick consistent shooting motion rarely force bad shot show excellent feel game passing ability also impressive show innate vision creativity make teammate better show excellent understanding playing pick roll facilitate teammate well come screen pull ups ability make play teammate passing ability set opportunity spot teammate drop ball dime full court anticipates game extremely well end floor see play happen leading breakaway steal well passing teammate open easy basket push ball floor well see entire floor making excellent decision solid ability utilize runner lane tree avert blocked shot 89 ft shooting confirms elite level shooting stroke solid foot speed quickness allows get defender creates separation scoring opportunity excellent ball handler solid getting defender bounce split double team handle full court pressure ease also show solid ability stop dime pull shot despite lack strength play toughness seems fight contact well finish either hand around basket sneaky athleticism ability get dunk get right momentum able gather foot toughness shown surprising 45 rebound per game fearless demeanor competitive player play fire passion never shy away big moment seems perform well end game pressure intensifies one high riskreward pick year draft may jumped gun nba career body come around watch,160 lb extremely thin leg underwhelming overall body strength underdeveloped body likely mean he year away nba ready especially defensive standpoint lack body strength hurt struggle face physical opponent get knocked balance drive improving core leg strength appears biggest obstacle player tough time adding carrying muscle mass interesting see kind gain make turn 20 sept 28th he young freshman get dunk ball breakaway generally play rim granted ball skill shooting important long term point guard athleticism ie curry v westbrook struggle finish play around rim due lack leg strength explosiveness nba readiness ability contribute immediately concern he extremely thin even college standard assist turnover number underwhelming need improve 32 26 additional core strength improve leaping ability also explosiveness dribble terry offense came pick roll spot ups rarely created isolation becoming better working space isolation beneficial,,6.292307694,2.5,15.73076923,-0.595405696,TBD,TBD,TBD,Y,0.9884,1

Shoots it well from deep and has good arc on shot, most of his makes find the bottom of the net. Hits shots from the NBA 3PT line and is a threat to score from literally anywhere in the half court. His jump shot keeps the defense tense and they must guard him tight away from the basket. Good free throw shooter … Gets to the rim off the dribble, using an effective crossover. Good variety and craft as a finisher. Finishes very well in the paint and in traffic, uses glass when appropriate. Good touch on floater … Good ambidexterity, doesn’t hesitate to use either hand dribbling, passing, or finishing. Creative playing style. Very good ballhandler. Creates for himself and others naturally … High basketball IQ. Tremendous instincts, read and reacts, never hesitates or second guesses himself. Supreme self-confidence. Finds the open man when the help defense comes. Tremendous court vision, passing, and playmaking ability, top of his class. Always knows where all four teammates are. Hits teammates in stride and when they’re in position to score. Can run the pick and roll/pop. Throws accurate outlet passes. Pushes the ball after rebounds, steals, and every other opportunity. Thrives in an up-tempo style but can also play in the half court … Good defender when committed both on and off the ball. Has a nose for the ball, gets clean steals when going for double teams. Good anticipation, jumps passing lanes very well to start instant offense. High steal count … Smooth. Quick hands and light on his feet. Good body control as a ballhandler and in the air. Changes speed and direction very well with the ball … Unselfish. Impacts the game without scoring, isn’t ineffective playing alongside other scorers, and compliments the talent around him. Sometimes he’s quick with the trigger but never forces his scoring or hunts for his shots. He tends to add points in bunches as needed or they accumulate as the game progresses … Rebounds very well on both ends for position … A triple-double threat in high school and impacts the game in multiple statistical categories … Nonchalant demeanor, doesn’t rattled under pressure … Has a lot of experience competing against grown men. Younger for his class, will turn 18 in August after high school. A full year younger than quite a few players who played in the high school all-star circuits. In one case, two full years younger …","His overall jump shot lacks any real consistency at the moment, and just like his older brother that can likely be attributed to his highly unorthodox shooting form … His release point is low, somewhere between his chin and his chest, and he shoots a set shot with below average elevation, leading to plenty of flat shots and bad misses whether open or contested (25% from 3point range on 6 attempts per game in 2019) … His mediocre FT shooting (72%) points to him potentially becoming a reasonably efficient shooter in time, but he’s a work in progress …. Ball’s shot selection will also need to improve, as he made just enough deep shots to both keep the defense honest, as well as justify (mostly to himself) that he should at times hoist low percentage shots off the dribble from all over the court … While a pretty good athlete, he is more smooth than dynamic and will only sporadically try to play above the rim in the half court … Should continue to add weight and strength to his improving frame, as he currently gets outmuscled by players with similar size on both ends of the court … Has some experience playing off the ball, but clearly is more effective making plays with the ball in his hands … At times can be turnover prone looking to make the home-run play when a simpler play is available … Doesn’t show any real consistent toughness or effort defensively, mostly interested in jumping passing lanes for run outs or trying to swipe for steals … Rarely stays alert or in a stance for full defensive possessions, has issues fighting through screens and may struggle to defend quicker PGs as a young pro … Seems like the type of player who will be asked to defend the other team’s worst perimeter scorer as he develops, but his defensive versatility (and effectiveness) could improve as he gets stronger and shows more awareness, largely due to his physical tools … There have been whispers that some teams may see Ball’s more nonchalant approach as a player as a questionable investment for a potential franchise player and top draft choice, though his improvement over the past few years seems to point to a determined, hard working young player …Smooth but not an incredibly explosive athlete. Doesn’t get much pop off two feet or in half court situations, especially compared to other guards in his class … Set point on shot is a bit low and he tends to fade a bit at times. Shot selection can improve, he’s a threat to score from anywhere but sometimes pulls up for deep and contested shots that aren’t necessary … Thrives in a fast-paced game, with that can come loose play and high turnovers … Skinny, lacks strength in both the upper and lower body … Can get more action off the ball, tends to drift at times. Roams defensively at times as well, gambling and looking for runout opportunities …","Younger brother of Lonzo Ball … High school career has been a wild ride: from Chino Hills, Lithuania, JBA League,

His uncommon skillset is visible right away in his ability to corral defensive rebounds and push the ball up the court effortlessly in transition … He is also great on the fast break off the ball, as he understands how to fill lanes correctly and get himself an easy finish at the rim … His impressively long strides also come to play in the half court, where he can catch from the arc and get all the way to the tin in one dribble … He has great extension when finishing at the rim, and his long wingspan allows him to finish above the rim in space … Tatum’s most intriguing selling point, however, is his highly advanced offensive skillset in the half court, and his NBA ready scoring ability … He is an exceptionally polished scorer for a 19 year old, having the ability to operate from all three levels. He is at his best in the mid-range area where he can create space and shoot over the top of the defense with a high release point on his jumper … He also has outstanding footwork and is never too sped up by the defense … Tatum excels out of the mid-post area as well where he has a variety of moves in his arsenal to beat his man … One of his weaknesses coming out of high school was his below average spot-up shooting from three-point territory … Tatum has improved in this area, as he is most certainly a capable threat from deep, especially off the drive and kick … He has also always been a terrific free-throw shooter (84.9% this season), which provides plenty of promise for further improvement down the road … He is also a good pick and pop threat when needed to play the four … He is particularly strong with his one dribble pull-up jumper going to his left, and he just does a great overall job of attacking hard closeouts with superb footwork … Tatum is probably the best isolation scorer in the draft as well … He utilizes a variety of hesitation pull-ups, jab steps, step backs, crossovers, spins, etc., and he can stop on a dime with ease to get into his shot … He was an absolute nightmare four opposing four men to guard, especially in the mid range, where he used his shiftiness and creativity to get into his mid-range game at will … He also is great at changing speeds in isolation situations to keep his defender off balance and get to the rim … Tatum is a handful to guard when facing up in the post … Defenders have to respect his ability to rise into his jump shot, but he counters this well with an explosive first step off the dribble going to his right … He also employs an occasional Dirk-like fall away jumper that is nearly impossible to guard, and he is great overall feel for where the defender is when posting up … He is still improving as a playmaker, but he has good vision in transition and can see over the top of the defense off the pick and roll … Tatum also has the tools to hold his own on the defensive end in the NBA as well in large part due to his size and length … He slides his feet very well when locked in and uses his length to his advantage (1.4 blocks and 1.6 steals per 40 minutes) … He can cover a lot of ground when closing out on shooters, as he would often run all the way from the ball side of the court and force a difficult shot when the ball was skipped over to his man … He also has the agility to contain quick perimeter players off the dribble and the length to consistently force contested shots … He shows flashes of great instincts and can cover a lot of ground rotating from the weak side to protect the rim … Tatum has good hands off the ball and anticipates passing lanes well … He proved to be a factor on the defensive glass, posting a clip 7.2 d-boards per 40 minutes … His professional approach to the game and work ethic are also noteworthy … He consistently demonstrated the ability to stay calm in pressure situations and come up big in crunch time … His game will fit well in the NBA, and he should be an immediate impact scorer … He is one of the more unique players in this draft and can be considered a low-risk, high-reward player …6’8 smooth and versatile wing prospect … Good size, length, and fluidity for a wing. Uses size and length to shoot over defenders. Good half-court offensive game … Can score and distribute out of the high post … Transitions well from set shooting position into a low driving position and vice versa … Advanced footwork. Uses pivots, step backs, and fade aways … Very good midrange scorer and has begun to extend his shooting range … Can score from multiple spots on the floor … Handles the ball well and has solid court vision. Can create for himself off the dribble … Has shown the ability to facilitate with the ball in his hands over his high school career … Does an excellent job of forcing contact and getting to the foul line … Understands how to play around the rim, can be a mismatch for smaller defenders as well as challenge bigger defenders … High level rebounder for a wing … Strong competitor. Seems to have self awareness and plays for the team … Solid defender, has the tools and ability to guard multiple positions … Shows surprising leadership for a player his age … Doesn’t have any major weaknesses to his game …","One of the first flaws that jump out in Tatum’s game is his inconsistent intensity on defense … At times, he seems to just go through the motions defensively and didn’t demonstrate the competitive desire to lock his man down … In addition, he is an excellent small-ball four on offense, but the same cannot be said about his defensive impact from this position … He is not physical enough to handle bigger players down low, and he needs to add some strength to his lower half … His technique on the perimeter can improve, as his closeouts can be quite lazy, allowing for his man to get by him with little resistance … He is also not the most physical perimeter defender and can do a better job of getting in his stance and containing the dribble … In transition, he does not always sprint back to the paint to help out against penetrating guards in the open court … In an NBA game nowadays that is heavily predicated on up-tempo offense with an abundance of quick guards who love to get in the lane on the break, this is something that he must address … One of the other question marks is that he is still a streaky spot-up shooter … He shot 34.3% from the arc at Duke this past season, which is not bad, but it is not good enough to classify him as an elite knockdown shooter … He is much better as a mid-range shooter and there are questions about if he will be able to adapt to the expanded three-point line in the NBA … Off the catch, his mechanics do not look quite as fluid when he is contested, and he is not always balanced on his release, which can also be a bit quicker … He also must become a more reliable scoring threat off the pick and roll … In these situations, defenders would mostly go under the ball screen, and he frequently would not make them pay with his pull up when this happened … Tatum also was guarded mostly by power forwards, so there are concerns about whether he will be able to create offense as effectively against NBA caliber wing players … His handle can be tightened, as he plays a bit too upright with the ball, making him less explosive … He does not have great burst from a stand still position, which causes him to struggle getting to the rim, and he has trouble finishing against top tier length and athleticism … This forces him to heavily rely on tough floaters and two-point jumpers, which is an inefficient way to score … Tatum can further refine his decision making on offense, as he can be too dependent on isolation offense, even if he excels in these situations … He is not the most comfortable playmaker on the move, and because of his inconsistent spot-up shooting in addition to that; there are questions about his effectiveness off the ball … These few factors will determine how high Tatum’s ceiling is …A high level athlete, but not a jump out of the gym freak … Lacks strength for physical play at higher levels but should add strength in time … Has the ability to make difficult shots but tends to settle for deep contested shots. Fades away at times when it’s unnecessary … Shooting is decent, but in need of improvement. Form doesn’t show any major issues, but is more of a solid shooter than knockdown at this point … Can improve range and consistency as a three point shooter … Can improve finishing in traffic by adding strength … Very long and smooth, but lacks a great burst off the dribble. First step is just average … Tends to over-dribble at times … Likely a 3 as his lack of great foot speed limits his effectiveness off the dribble, and his size and shooting fits the 3 position …","Tatum has been on the radar for a few years and considered one of the top prospects in the talented 2016 high school class.  His commitment along with Harry Giles headlines a talented incoming Duke freshman class and projects to make an impact early on. He was named to the McDonald’s All American Game, Jordan Brand Classic, and Nike Hoop Summit; with a solid showing in each game.","Measured 6’8.25 in shoes, 204 lbs, 6’11 wingspan, and a 8’10.5

Finishes plays above the rim that most of his peers can’t contest. Quick off the ground and translates his athleticism well into game situations with good body control and hang time. Finishes with either hand in traffic … Versatile skillset. Effective in both half-court and transition … Good scoring ability and his ability to create has made great improvement over the past year as the game has slowed down for him and instincts have taken over. Averaged 9 points per game at 50% FG% over the Nike EYBL in 2018 and averaged 22.7 points per game at 48.9% FG% in 2019 … Shooting range extends to the 3PT line and he can hit shots off the dribble … Solid ball handler and playmaker with ability as an initiator, showing positive strides making reads with the ball. Passes out of drives and midway through his attack when the help defense comes … Quick burst with the ball. Good dribble penetrator and slasher going to his right or left. Sells crossover and changes direction well with the ball. Fearless driver and isn’t afraid to throw down dunks in traffic … Good tools and versatility as a defender. Good timing and elevation when blocking shots … Strong build and strength level, yet still fluid. Finishes and plays well through contact. Draws fouls at a good rate. Shot 5.7 free throws per game over the Nike EYBL in 2019 … Stays active off the ball … Good confidence and aggression … Has shown noticeable improvement in multiple areas of his game in the past year and his skillset is catching up his natural ability …","Lacks consistency shooting … Kuminga is an incredibly talented player, and one with loads of potential, but the skill that will likely make-or-break him reaching that potential is how much he can improve upon his shooting consistency and range … He averaged just 24.6% from deep, and 62.5% from the foul line … Those numbers simply won’t cut it at the next level, and will severely limit Kuminga’s minutes and impact … Until he bumps those up, he may have to play more as a power forward, even if his best fit is at the small forward position … Lacked moves in the post, and often used the same spin move every time he got on the block … Kuminga needs more diversity in his post moves if he wants to score against bigger, stronger defenders … Can make difficult finishes, but sometimes botches easy ones … He needs to spend time developing his offensive game, as it is clear that checks every athletic and size box, but can look overwhelmed at times during games on offense … Turned the ball over as much as he assisted, and while he can make excellent passes, Kuminga also struggled with decision making …Can be too quick with the trigger and settles for a lot of contested threes. Shot selection overall can improve and although he’s been efficient from the floor, he’s very high-volume. Attempted 17.2 shots per game over the Nike EYBL in 2019 … Can improve consistency as a 3PT shooter. Shot 29.8% 3PT% at 7.8 attempts per game over the Nike EYBL in 2019 … Can improve as a free throw shooter. Shot 55.2% FT% over the Nike EYBL in 2018 and 62.7% FT% in 2019 … Doesn’t stand out as a rebounder as you would think from someone with his size and ability. Averaged 3.7 rebounds per game over the Nike EYBL in 2018 and 5.4 rebounds per game in 2019 … Although playmaking has improved, he can work on limiting the turnovers. Tries to make the home run play at times. Averaged 3.2 assists to 3.5 turnovers per game over the Nike EYBL in 2019 … Can show more commitment on the defensive end, tends to coast a bit and can get caught watching …",Transferred from Our Savior New American to The Patrick School … 2019 All-EYBL: Second Team and Underclass Team … Played in the 2018 Underclassman All-American Game and earned MVP of the 2019 Underclassman All-American Game in 2019 with 21 points …,Measured: 6’7 with a 6’11 wingspan and 217.2 lbs at the 2019 Nike Elite 100 camp  …,,yes,14.2,0.102,0.2,listed 67 220 pound kuminga physical force end court freakish athlete explosiveness strength great body control also solid skill set ability handle pas ball forte appears le glamorous defensive end quickness strength height disrupt opposing wing forward kuminga build speed drive defend position 14 nba used limit team primary scoring option versatile piece switching screen play turnover forcing machine one steal per game kuminga immediately become one better adaptable skilled defender nba offensive game similar intrigue great handle player size adept creating shot dribble elizabeth new jersey native excels driving rack finish well paint even defense collapse like work post score easily especially mismatch wellrounded offensive game knock jumper penetrate solid passer positionis elite transition player well tremendous speed size hustle player often leading easy dunk solid scorer rebounder 158 point 72 rebound per contest tremendous athleticism raise floor ceiling help contribute greater offensive output whenif shooting ability develops one youngest prospect draft already competing highlevel talented competition nba ready body 68 athletic wing good length 611 wingspan highlevel explosive athlete finish play rim peer cant contest quick ground translates athleticism well game situation good body control hang time finish either hand traffic versatile skillset effective halfcourt transition good scoring ability ability create made great improvement past year game slowed instinct taken averaged 9 point per game 50 fg nike eybl 2018 averaged 227 point per game 489 fg 2019 shooting range extends 3pt line hit shot dribble solid ball handler playmaker ability initiator showing positive stride making read ball pass drive midway attack help defense come quick burst ball good dribble penetrator slasher going right left sell crossover change direction well ball fearless driver isnt afraid throw dunk traffic good tool versatility defender good timing elevation blocking shot strong build strength level yet still fluid finish play well contact draw foul good rate shot 57 free throw per game nike eybl 2019 stay active ball good confidence aggression shown noticeable improvement multiple area game past year skillset catching natural ability,lack consistency shooting kuminga incredibly talented player one load potential skill likely makeorbreak reaching potential much improve upon shooting consistency range averaged 246 deep 625 foul line number simply wont cut next level severely limit kumingas minute impact bump may play power forward even best fit small forward position lacked move post often used spin move every time got block kuminga need diversity post move want score bigger stronger defender make difficult finish sometimes botch easy one need spend time developing offensive game clear check every athletic size box look overwhelmed time game offense turned ball much assisted make excellent pass kuminga also struggled decision making quick trigger settle lot contested three shot selection overall improve although he efficient floor he highvolume attempted 172 shot per game nike eybl 2019 improve consistency 3pt shooter shot 298 3pt 78 attempt per game nike eybl 2019 improve free throw shooter shot 552 ft nike eybl 2018 627 ft 2019 doesnt stand rebounder would think someone size ability averaged 37 rebound per game nike eybl 2018 54 rebound per game 2019 although playmaking improved work limiting turnover try make home run play time averaged 32 assist 35 turnover per game nike eybl 2019 show commitment defensive end tends coast bit get caught watching,transferred savior new american patrick school 2019 alleybl second team underclass team played 2018 underclassman allamerican game earned mvp 2019 underclassman allamerican game 2019 21 point,33.2729927,1.3,43.25489051,0.537579409,TBD,TBD,TBD,N,0.9894,1

Versatile offensive skill set to score inside/outside (16.5 PPG). Could be seen as being big enough to play center in today’s NBA. He possesses rare agility at 6’11 in tandem with a hunger for activity and relentless motor. Runs the court like a guard, with a fluid gait and long, easy strides.  Nightmare matchup for opponents on the interior due to explosive quickness and elevation. Extraordinarily nimble and quick mover in the paint. He has added strength and bulk (225 to 240) without losing that calling card explosiveness. Uses his athleticism to earn high percentage looks (58%), elevating above defenders. Displays a deft touch and equally adept at finishing with his left hand. Electric spin moves in the post over either shoulder, preferring to attack baseline. Body control and hang time to make the appropriate in-air adjustments and alter release after a bump or if impeded. 83% free throw shooter on over 5 attempts (65% as sophomore). Rebounds at will on both the offensive and defensive backboards, ranking amongst the nation’s leaders with 10.8 per game. Quick leaper on multiple jumps while still retaining 1st jump lift. Utilizes his length and mobility to rebound out his direct vicinity. Flourished on the perimeter during his time at UTEP, albeit in a more liberal style of play. Comfortable in the mid-range with the ability to step out behind the three-point stripe. He has the potential to be an effective face-up weapon with a quick first step and long frame. Had a tendency to play in a “rushed state” early in his collegiate career, but has found an efficient pace his junior season. Doesn’t force shots and playing within a more defined role for the betterment of the team. He displays legit lateral quickness and foot speed to defend on the perimeter and not look like a fish out of water. Multiple position defensive adaptability. Mentally and physically a different player since arriving in the SEC.Late blooming post player with a bright future (young for a sophomore – will be 19 in a week) … Has an excellent combination of length and agility … Explosive big who plays above the rim and displays good body control … Moves exceptionally well for a player his size showing the ability to run the floor like a guard … Plays a physical game with good strength and willingness to mix it up inside … Solid offensive game with nice potential. Shows good creativity on post moves using spin moves and up-and-unders and good touch around the basket … Likes to face the basket and take opponents off the dribble, but can also create with his back to the basket … Can effectively take opponents off the dribble all the way out past the 3 point line (tremendous foot speed for a 4) … Effectively utilizes the turnaround hook shot … Good form on his shot with a solid baseline jumper … An excellent rebounder (8.2 rpg as a freshman) with quick leaping ability and good length … Has very quick feet and moves well to cover a lot of ground on rebounds … Plays with a high motor … Displays excellent hands, a necessity for quality post players … Shows the ability to catch and shoot from 3 point range (shot 37 3s converting on 11 as a freshman) …","Moultrie seems to have transitioned from a SF to PF this season, sacrificing continued perimeter development in the process. Being that he’s not a true post option, he’ll likely see time at both spots on the next level. He’s caught somewhere in between, which can actually be viewed as a strength and serves to illustrate his versatility. Has shown glimpses of range shooting and ball handling aptitude, but more is required for the NBA small forward position.  As he exhibited at UTEP, the potential to be a dynamic face up player is very much present. It’s that potential alone, despite his raw attributes that once again has scouts drooling over his package of skills. Not the most technically sound of prospects, relying on his massive (on most nights) talent, size and athletic advantage. Plays too quickly at times (2.2 TO) and must harness his energy. Could still stand to add more bulk, be more accepting of contact and get to the FT line more consistently. When he begins a move, thinks score only. Not selfish, but at the same time not a prudent passer when attracting defensive attention. At 6’11 with his length and leaping ability, it is inexplicable that he hasn’t been able to block a shot per game (0.9) in any of his three seasons. Basketball IQ and awareness on both ends should sharpen with experience. Moultrie has missed three games in 2011-2012 with tendinitis in both knees. Should continue to extend range and improve on his outside shooting … Free throw shooting was surprisingly low for a player who shows solid form (54 FT% needs to improve) … Can be too enamored at times with facing the basket and neglect his physical strength inside … Shows solid rebounding ability but could improve with a little more attention to details, boxing out and finding his man and using post position, instead of just relying on his physical attributes … Not a great passer.

201563,Michael Beasley,2008,1,2,2,Draft,1610612748,Miami,Heat,MIA,Kansas State,College/University,1,Michael,Beasley,,,84.0,Carmelo Anthony," A fabulous athlete with an NBA ready body… Completed one of the most dominant seasons in college basketball history, as a freshman His length, quickness, jumping ability and strength combine to make him one of the most difficult match ups He has range from anywhere on the floor all the way out to NBA three, but is especially effective with his soft touch around the rim, where he uses both hands to finish with a variety of moves His left handed jump shot is a thing of beauty, with a smooth release, he has good arc and is very balanced getting his legs under him to get great elevation Most dangerous out of the mid-post where he can square his man up, and attack with a variety of moves; including strong takes to the hoop, a nice midrange pull-up, or simply shooting over the top of helpless defenders From the triple threat his jabs and shot fakes are extremely efficient because he not only has a quick first step, but also a very long one that allows him to get by people at will When the defender tries to beat him to the spot, he has a terrific spin move that is virtually unstoppable His post game has progressed nicely, and he has shown a nice touch on a variety of hook-shots and fadeaways … He fights hard to get good position on the block, and even harder when crashing the O glass, as seen by the 4 offensive rebounds that he averaged per game His ability to play the passing lanes and come over weakside to block shots, further adds to his ability to fill the stat sheet A strong personality with great confidence who never gets down on himself. There are few doubts about him becoming a bigtime impact talent at the next level …Weaknesses: Even though he has great length and body strength, he is somewhat undersized for the PF spot at the next level His perimeter skills, while effective against weaker competition, may not be refined enough to allow him to move over to the SF position just yet, so there are some question marks regarding his position His game is based on sheer athleticism and strength, but his actual basketball skills can use some refinement Going right he is very shaky, and struggles dribbling the ball more than twice with his right hand He has decent footwork in the post, but an overall lack of go-to moves, forces him to at times get out of control and to leave his feet and throw up some ill-advised shots, although his ability to create in these situations is remarkable His mentality is to score no matter how many people are guarding him, countless times, he would find himself facing a double or even triple team, yet he would still opt to shoot instead of finding an open teammate. Something that can be at least partially attributed to a lack of quality teammates Averaged a measly 1.2 assists per game, which may not only be a testament to his scoring mentality, but also to his marginal vision His decision making is also suspect at times, he gets into trouble by trying to do too much, then attempts to throw difficult passes Defensively, he has come a long way from simply wondering around the court, but that doesnt mean that he is by any means a stopper just yet. He has the potential to be an incredible defender, but he has yet to show the willingness to get nasty and play with the same effort on that end of the floor Man to man, he is decent and shows improved desire but can improve From a team standpoint, he is still not very good at reading angles and being in good help position but that should come with experience There is some concern about his work ethic and whether cashing huge checks before the age of 19 will have an effect on his motor.Notes: His on-court demeanor has looked very good throughout the year, as he has shown no signs of the previous attitude problems Off the court he has matured very nicely as well, and most of the problems that have plagued him throughout high-school seem to have dissipatedDrew Wolin – 2/15/2007Strengths: Incredibly diverse and refined offensive game Strong inside/outside skills From the block, he can give you a drop step, jump hook, and/or fade-away He can post up 15 feet out and take his man off the dribble, pop a J in the defender’s eye, take a fade-away, or find a cutting teammate He can catch and shoot from anywhere out to 25 feet Has great range on his shot He can bring the ball up the court and go to work on his man or find open teammates Very good on the break. Big time athlete with great explosiveness – a powerful dunker Makes a habit of producing highlight reel dunks Excellent body control Lefty with good length and great body strength Has a definite swagger on the court. Brash. Has a big personality and presence Very aggressive player, who intimidates most players on the high school level. Gets inside the heads of his opponents Has a nastiness to his game, that you like to see Can be a huge intimidator, because he will back-up anything he saysWeaknesses: Maturity. Some feel that he has an attitude problem, and lacks the discipline to be coached A year under Bob Huggins should help him considerably Defense and effort. He occasionally coasts through entire games There is a theory that he is so much better than his competition that he gets bored Incredibly, he will literally walk through warm-ups and appear to play at less than half speed, and still easily be the most dominant player on the court against prep school teams with 7+ division one players From watching him play, you would think that he has a bad attitude, though his coaches say he is a hard worker in practice (which explains his advanced offensive arsenal) Puts in very little effort on defense at this point, though does block shots thanks to his athleticism, timing, and size Could eventually become a decent defender, though will never be his calling card The game comes so easily to him, some wonder if he’s willing to work to be the player he can beAran Smith & Benjamin Egger – 1/16/2006Strengths: Versatile forward with a long wingspan and great body strength An elite level athlete, really gets high off the floor … Has an excellent inside/outside game, with the ability to bang down low as well as face the basket and drive or shoot … Has all the physical skills one would want, size, handle, shot Plays the game with a swagger, high level of confidence … He can step out to 18 ft and knock down the J and his 3 point shot is gaining consistency Good form on his stroke Has the handle and strength to drive the lane, almost at will, and can finish once he gets there Tremendous rebounder, snatches boards above the box …","Even though he has great length and body strength, he is somewhat undersized for the PF spot at the next level His perimeter skills, while effective against weaker competition, may not be refined enough to allow him to move over to the SF position just yet, so there are some question marks regarding his position His game is based on sheer athleticism and strength, but his actual basketball skills can use some refinement Going right he is very shaky, and struggles dribbling the ball more than twice with his right hand He has decent footwork in the post, but an overall lack of go-to moves, forces him to at times get out of control and to leave his feet and throw up some ill-advised shots, although his ability to create in these situations is remarkable His mentality is to score no matter how many people are guarding him, countless times, he would find himself facing a double or even triple team, yet he would still opt to shoot instead of finding an open teammate.

attitude, though his coaches say he is a hard worker in practice (which explains his advanced offensive arsenal) Puts in very little effort on defense at this point, though does block shots thanks to his athleticism, timing, and size Could eventually become a decent defender, though will never be his calling card The game comes so easily to him, some wonder if he’s willing to work to be the player he can beThe game almost comes too easily to him, he must prove he’s willing to work hard to continue improving … Doesn’t fit a position especially well, but has the size and speed to play both forward positions effectively … A little slow footed for the perimeter, and closer to 6-8 than 6-9 … He shows flashes of immense talent to be a big time NBA player, but must continue to work on many parts of his game … Still has a lot of work to do before he becomes a consistent player, especially mentally Lacks the ability to elevate the play of his teammates, his vision and passing skills are just average … Can get frustrated when things aren’t going well, needs maturity, mental toughness … Play can become lazy and unfocused at times Lacks consistency While his game can be dominant against

Scores in bunches and creates offense from scratch. Gets into the flow of the game and can get hot quickly. Good step back jump shot and has good rhythm off the dribble. Can score from multiple spots on the floor. Shoots well from three and has added consistency. Shot 40.2% from three over the Nike EYBL. Moves well without the ball and spaces the floor … Good slashing ability. Gets to the rim without over dribbling. Creates off the dribble in the half court and plays well in transition. Handles the ball well and knows how to sell his crossover. Changes directions at full speed very well. Changes speeds with the ball. Adjusts to the defense at the rim. Good body control in the air and uses angles very well … Knows how to get to the free throw line … High level athlete. Good speed and quick first step … Fits in with his team no matter who he’s playing with … Active perimeter defender. Has the quickness and length to be a very good defender …","Lacks defensive intensity, especially off the ball, as he has a habit of floating around the court instead of remaining engaged … Looks lost at times on offense when the ball isn’t in his hands … Needs to have the ball in order to be a threat offensively, but likely won’t be the primary option on offense, will need to develop his off the ball game. Staying more active and using teammates to run his defender off screens to create open looks … Has a narrow shot base on his jumper, which makes it easier for him to find himself off balance on jump shots … Has a tendency to settle for jump shots instead of probing the defense … Focuses on scoring and as a result will sometimes force his offense or miss passing to an open teammate … Needs to improve his court vision, especially in drive and kick opportunities … Needs to ensure that he plays hard all the time, sometimes appears to be trying to conserve energy for the offensive end … Not an efficient scorer, projects more as a volume scorer … Should get to the free throw line more than he does, but will need to improve his free throw percentage to feel comfortable going to the charity stripe often …While he scores well, he doesn’t always impact other areas of the game. Strictly a two-guard, makes some impressive passes on occasions but is raw overall as a playmaker … Can be quick with the trigger at times. Settles for contested shots. Although it works for him at times, he will attack well contested spots while trying to score on multiple defenders. Tries to do too much at times, would benefit by keeping it simple … Uses his hands too much on defense.

Naturally gifted scorer (28 ppg as a HS senior) with a deadly shooting eye. Prolific shooter from beyond the arc with tremendous range. Pure stroke with a quick, smooth release. No hitches … Uses his legs very well on his shot getting good lift … Effective slashing to the hoop where he can attack the rim and seek out contact … Finishes extremely well, shrugging off defenders with ease … Gets to the free throw line regularly and is automatic. Active on the glass … Can be a terrific rebounding wing with his strength and freakish wingspan (6.7 per game in 2009 and 7.2 in 2008) … A thief when playing off the ball defensively, reading passing lanes and intercepting passes (1.7 spg through his first seven collegiate games). Refreshing positive attitude on the court. Always smiling, seeming to truly enjoy the game of basketball … Hard worker and very coachable, which is rare for a player of his stature. ","A strong athlete but not an elite level athlete … Does not possess explosive speed, quicks or leaping ability, although his leaping ability is better than his foot speed … His first step is mediocre and his face up game lacks creativity … His options are limited when he puts the ball on the floor and is quite predictable … Ball handling needs to improve drastically. Turnovers have been a bugaboo early on at 2 per game … Needs to develop his right hand. Too left hand dominant on the dribble and on the finish … Settles for too many long range shots. Should take advantage of his strength inside and attack more. Lack of comfort in the post game. He has the physical edge against any college SG or SF and would be wise to exploit it … Defense runs through positive and negative patches. At times plays with excellent passion, and other times appears to be going through the motions … Lateral quickness is not ideal, but his strength and length can mask that deficiency.",,"Originally committed to Memphis, but later asked for his release after John Calipari left for Kentucky.

1628397,Ivan Rabb,2017,2,5,35,Draft,1610612753,Orlando,Magic,ORL,California,College/University,1,Ivan,Rabb,,,93.0,Andrew Nicholson/PJ Brown,"There is plenty to like about Raab as a NBA prospect starting with his physical profile … He is a mobile big man with good size at 6’10” with a 7’2” wingspan and 9’1” standing reach, and he is light on his feet … Out of the pick and roll, he shows great agility as a roll man, and he can catch and finish lob passes in space … Rabb also runs the floor pretty well despite the limited opportunities he got playing in California’s slow tempo system … He is more mobile than most big men that guard him, which was displayed frequently by beating other bigs down the floor in transition … Rabb’s most established skill that will be a great asset for a team in the NBA is his rebounding ability … Posted 19 double-digit rebounding games this past season for Cal and averaged 12.8 rebounds per 40 minutes, showing good motor on the offensive glass as well (3.7 offensive rebounds per 40) … He also demonstrated one of the best pairs of hands in all of college basketball the last two years, which is shown by his ability to chase down rebounds out of his area … He has a large rebounding radius, great timing and instincts on his jump to corral missed shots, and he does an excellent job of finding a body when a shot goes up … He is also a great rebounder in traffic, as he does not shy away from contact down low and is aggressive pursuing the ball off the rim … Rabb has a blossoming post game both facing up and with his back to the basket … He also has improved his face up jump shot and is particularly difficult to guard when the defense has to respect his jumper … He shows flashes of excellent footwork and can finish at the rim from awkward angles with either hand . Rabb is also a big target in the post with his long arms and great hands. He is a bit streaky but definitely capable in the mid-range game, as he utilizes both jab steps and step backs to create separation into his shot. He is crafty in the post with his footwork and is particularly light on his feet when under duress down low … Also has an underrated basketball IQ, and has good feel for recognizing double teams and knowing when to pass out of them … He also has a good understanding of defensive positioning and handled the often-difficult moments at Cal quite maturely … He has good recognition off the ball on defense and does a good job of not fouling when coming over to help from the weak side … His above average ability to close out and defend bigs on the perimeter will help him in today’s NBA …With a slight frame, for now, Rabb is very good at gaining position against defenders in the low post … At 6’10 once Rabb got near the hoop he was virtually automatic against high school competition at the rim … He has developed a consistent baby left hook shot that is his go-to move … Rabb is also very explosive laterally … Even when caught in tight spaces or too deep in the paint he possesses the athleticism to still get a good shot attempt or dunk attempt off … Doesn’t sit idle often or slough off when posting up … Mostly catches the ball and explodes right into a move … Very active on the break for a big man … Whether off a block or a rebound he will run up and down the floor until he’s blue in the face … Finishes well as a trailer and often created second chance opportunities for himself or others off a miss … Very effective rim protector … Quick to help, but doesn’t leave his feet early … Let’s the offensive player come to him before trying for a block … Uses his feet well to reposition himself for blocks … His large wingspan (7’1"") is also a big help on defense … Can pass well out of double teams and is a good overall passer … Very aware of floor spacing and where teammates and even defenders are positioned …","Rabb is more of an old school post player and does not have ideal perimeter skills that NBA teams look for in a modern NBA big man … He does not space the floor with great consistency and shoots a flat ball at times … He will need to become more of a threat off the pick and pop to be a truly reliable offensive weapon in the league, and he must continue to improve as a free throw shooter (66%) … He also does not have the ball skills to create for himself on the perimeter, and most of his scoring will come in the post … He is much better as a straight-line driver, but when the defense takes this away, he is not fluid or skilled enough to utilize a counter move and create offense for himself effectively … He also struggles to attack closeouts off the pick and pop, which really limits him offensively … Lacks the strength to finish against NBA caliber big men with better length and athleticism … His skillset projects towards him being more of a center in the NBA, but he may not have the size and strength to be effective there … He can be knocked out of position pretty easily and does not have good body control against contact … This sort of tweener identity limits his defensive potential as well, as he is a tad small for the five and not quite rangy enough for the four … He is limited as a rim protector with only 1.3 blocks per 40 minutes, and could be a liability in the pick and roll when needed to switch out against smaller players …Besides his baby hook, doesn’t have an array of post moves in his repertoire … Has mostly relied on being taller and more athletic than most of his competition … Must get stronger and fill out his frame as much as possible … Can easily be knocked off his spot in the paint … Besides rim protection he’s not really a great overall defender … Not quick laterally and often doesn’t seem to be moving fluidly when defending on the ball … Strictly a post player at this point, Rabb hasn’t adapted to the new ""position less basketball"" movement … If he’s not able to score in the post he will drift out to the perimeter, which isn’t the strongest part of his game at the

Standing at 6’5, he’s able to scan the defense unfettered, flashing tremendous court vision and a natural creativity (7.2 AST as junior, 6th in NCAA) … Plays at a comfortable pace with the ball in his hands; chews up ground with long strides, but gives off the impression of “gliding” … Takes advantage of his height on the glass- active contributor on the defensive backboard (3.7 DRPG) and instant fast break threat … Dangerous in transition where he’s dynamic with the ball and forces defenses to commit, often resulting in the proper shoot/pass decision … Boasts a 4:1 AST: TO ratio and 1.5 points + assists/possession in open court situations … Deceiving quickness, lulls defenders into a particular speed before changing gears … Hang time and acrobatics are readily apparent around the rim, preferring brush contact to sustain momentum … Floaters, runners and leaners are more his cup of tea than traditional, set jumpers … Shows potential with his back to the basket in a limited sampling … Strong penchant for making plays on the defensive side of the ball (2 SPG). Brown displays huge upside as an on-ball defender, allowing .59 PPP last season when isolated … He crowds ball handlers with his length and lateral quickness forcing them into panic halted dribbles … Also possesses quick hands to reel in the fish … Instinctual anticipation of habit moves/passes … When operating in full flight, he’s a prospect worth salivating over …Brown is a physically gifted combo guard at 6’5 190 … Pretty fluid athlete with solid quickness … Relishes his opportunities to handle the ball a lot on offense, and is a very good ball-handler too … The game looks natural for him when has the ball in his hands, he gets around the floor easily and is able to use his fluidity to get where he wants on the court … Good instincts … Pretty shifty … Is a developing scorer, but has some natural ability to put the ball in the hoop from 20 ft on in with effectiveness … Not a bad spot-up shooter, with range out to about 22 ft … Shows a developing floater … Is a really intriguing passer for a player, and averaged 6.3 apg as a sophomore … Pretty unselfish, and does a good job of knowing when to look for his shot and when to make feeds to teammates … Good pick and roll player … Can play up tempo and is generally a good decision maker when in transition … Was more aggressive as a soph. when driving the line and seeking out contact, even if he’s still developing his strength … Is a very quick handed defender who uses the size and length advantage he has over more PG’s to his advantage, coming up with a good number of blocks and steals for a PG (1.8 spg and 0.5 bpg) … Also is a good rebounder for a perimeter player (4.5 rpg as a Soph) … Will be able to defend both guard spots in the NBA … Really took advantage of being the lead guard last season under a new coaching staff and the loss of Ryan Harrow … Will be depended on to provide 30 mpg next season once again … Brown has very good upside and will only get better as he gains experience and strength …","While Brown can seemingly get to any spot on the court he pleases, finishing plays is another story … He shot 29% on jumpers off the bounce and struggled to score when not driving to his left … In NC State’s limited use of the pick and roll (54 possessions) he turned the ball over nearly 17% of the time (3.5 TO overall) … His feel for the P&R, in terms of quick digestion of information and subsequent decision making, needs vast development … Ironically, his pace of play should suite that style to a tee … His half-court game is marked by indecision and lack of efficiency, missing a go-to move or a comfort play … For all his success breaking down defenders 1 on 1 and in transition, he doesn’t get his team into functional sets … Shot 26% from three-point range as a junior … On all jumpers: shot 28% in spot up opportunities and 26% off the catch-and-shoot. Tendency to drift away from the action when not the focal point of a play; his position is at the point … Takes an inordinate numbers of risks defensively, getting out of position, and collapsing the team defensive scheme …  He avoids straight-on contact and playing in the post, two facets that should be staples … Not an explosive finisher– would be well served to add his strength to his 186 pound frame. The perimeter won’t be where he earns his bread … “Underachiever” was the word of choice in Raleigh.Right now, Brown is a bit raw and is still a bit of a tweener guard … He has the size of a SG, and the unselfishness of a PG, but he’s missing some key skills to fit naturally at both spots … He’s not the type of knockdown shooter that fits best off the ball, but he also doesn’t show the consistent decision making and natural leadership of a pure lead guard … Must work on cutting down on his turnovers some more (3.2 topg) … Not especially strong, and it can show when he tries to finish around the trees around the rim … Not overly explosive athletically, much more of a fluid guy than someone who will make acrobatic plays … To his credit, as he gains strength he probably will improve athletically, seems to have more athletic upside with more weight training … Needs to improve his jumper, loses effectiveness with his shot the further out he shoots, and isn’t as consistent a shooter off the bounce as he has the potential to be … Needs to be a tougher defender, sometimes gives lackluster effort …",,," Brown has very good upside, and was one of the most intriguing players in the ACC last season with his size and passing skills … He has the potential to be a matchup ploy in the NBA, and he largely is just that at the college level … He needs to work on his shot, and gaining

He now has the ability to bang down low that he has somewhat lacked in the past. While being known as a player who is best when working in the high post from either elbow, he has displayed a solid game from the baseline recently, where he can turn over either shoulder to hit the baseline jumper. He has added a behind the back dribble move to his repertoire that isnt fully reliable yet, but will make him a little more dangerous when working from the top of the key nonetheless. His leadership has developed more and he is a reliable go to guy offensively in the post. Defensively, his post position is very good, so he shouldnt have too many problems with man-to-man defense at the next level.Weaknesses: Koufos must get better at finishing at the rim after contact. He has great touch around the basket, but when he takes contact, his shot doesnt often find the basket. His timing is good on blocked shots, but dont expect him to be much of an intimidator with this skill in the NBA due to average to just above average athleticism. While his midrange shooting is excellent, he could stand to extend his range a little bit. If he could consistently hit the college three it would be an excellent weapon for him and his team.Notes: Turned down a multi-million dollar offer from Olympiacos Piraeus to play professionallyJoshua Motenko – 7/29/2006 Strengths: A very skilled big man, Koufos shows the ability and desire to be a great passer from the post He is also comfortable putting the ball on the floor, but lacks the athleticism and foot speed to be too much of a threat off the dribble Although on the college level, he can take the ball off the dribble very effectively and ever from the top of the key He is an excellent free throw shooter, can hit the three ball, and has a nice midrange jumper Hes got great hands, decent post moves, and a consistent touch around the basket as well Hes a very smart person with a good sense of humor off the court as an honor roll student He has a good feel for the game on the court as well, and is very mobile for a 7 footer He is comfortable playing in the high post.

(79 FT% on 4.5 FTA/G) … Was willing to chip in on the glass from the perimeter as a Fr. (4.2 RPG) … Had to play off the ball more often than he’s accustomed to this past season, which in a way may have helped accelerate his development in rounding out his offensive game … Some flashes of pick and roll playmaking; will likely be given chances to develop into a secondary playmaker at the next level (2.8 APG) … Has instant offense/microwave scorer type traits …","Mediocre physical and athletic profile for an NBA guard prospect … Not really an above the rim finisher, relies heavily on skill and creativity to pressure the rim and finish in the paint … Can be a bit of a chucker currently (33.8 3FG% on about 7 3FGA/G); would probably see a spike in his efficiency by being more judicious with his shot selection (37.6 FG%) … Makes just enough lower percentage, contested shots to encourage himself to keep taking them and those shots will be more difficult to see success with at the pro level … More streaky than a truly reliable knockdown shooter right now despite his tools…Posted a negative A:TO (2.8:2.9), which is not ideal for a player considered to be combo guard and speaks to a lack of natural playmaking skills for others…Tends to be pretty deliberate with where he wants to go with the ball on his feeds and should work on not telegraphing his passes … Will at times over-dribble and try to create plays that aren’t there … Doesn’t handle being blitzed in pick and roll coverage very well right now; struggles to turn the corner off the dribble due to his middling speed and can get smothered or forced into wasted possessions … Feel for the game and basketball IQ are both a work in progress … Fair to question what type of impact he can have on games at the next level if his shots aren’t falling  …  Can have lapses on defense and should work on his fundamentals as an on-ball defender; particularly with consistently sinking his hips and moving his feet with a purpose … The idea of what he can become is greater than the sum of his parts right now; still pretty green and in need of polish & experience … Weight and conditioning will be something he has to stay focused on, as he has a history of weight gain …Has room to tighten up and improve his body, has shown in his (lack of) athleticism and explosion/quickness closing out his high school career … Still has room to improve 3PT consistency as he’s more on the streaky side. Doesn’t consistently make his open knock-down opportunities but the foundation is there … Solid passer and ball-handler but has a way to go if he’s going to run the point, even as a combo, at the next levels.

1628962,Udoka Azubuike,2020,1,27,27,Draft,1610612762,Utah,Jazz,UTA,Kansas,College/University,1,Udoka,Azubuike,,,91.0,Bismack Biyombo,"Udoka Azubuike’s most obvious strength is pretty hard to miss. He is very big. At 7 feet .25 inches in shoes, and possessing an elite 7’7” wingspan he’s extremely long. Even better, after years in the weight room he’s molded himself into a lean, muscular 260 pound athlete. Dok can hold his own with the biggest and strongest of NBA centers. His size and length give him immediate translatable skills like rebounding and the ability to defend the rim. Azubuike isn’t a stiff either. At the 2020 combine he measured a freakish 37 inch max standing vertical leap, which allowed him to hit the 12’6” mark without any sort of run. After averaging 2.6 blocks per game as a senior at Kansas, Udoka’s size and spring will render him at the very least a plus rim defender in the NBA with the potential to be elite. While not the quickest lateral player his 7’7” wingspan also makes him extremely effective guarding the entire paint area, and extremely effective in one on one post matchups, help and rotational situations in the lane. Even in a more spaced out environment, he would be a major deterrent for offensive players to test their luck in the paint. While not a guy you really want running around by the 3 point line, he’s developed into a solid pick and roll defender too with the ability to effectively switch and stay out of foul trouble. Dok truly was a historic figure in NCAA D1 Hoops. Over four seasons at Kansas he shot .7465% from the field, good for first all time. No, Azubuike isn’t going to impress you with a vast array of post moves, but he is an extremely effective finisher, with the length and girth to be a high level pick and roll target and finisher at the rim at the NBA level. Chances are if he gets the ball in the low post, he’s going to score. Dok upped his rebounding every season at Kansas, and his 10.5 rebounds per game as a senior (3.5 offensive) are good indicators that he’ll be able to collect misses at a good clip at the next level. Over four years he really transformed his body. Dok lost fat, gained muscle and athleticism, and improved endurance which really aided in being in the position to be talked about entering the NBA draft. While not your typical face up big man of 2020, Dok is good enough at what he does (and good enough to be able to do it in the NBA) to be looked at as a potential draft pick or two way player. After seeing how unpolished he was 4 years ago, it’s a testament to his work ethic, which is also another strength6’11 athletic big man … Great size, strength, and aggression. Has great length with a 7’5 wingspan. Takes up a lot of space and holds position against the biggest opponents … Plays physical and likes to bang. It’s common for defenders to get out of the way after he catches it where he wants it and attacks. Needs to be tracked every offensive possession and wears down the man guarding him … Explosive athlete. Gets off the ground very well for a player with his size. Reliable finisher … Good shot blocker. Can serve as an anchor on defense … Very good rebounder on both ends. Holds position well and secures nearly everything he can get his hand on … Shows some touch and a developing jump hook from in close for a solid foundation for a back to the basket game … Embraces his role as a big man. Doesn’t try to step out to the perimeter and play outside his game …","In 1992 we might be talking about a player like Azubuike being picked up in the lottery, but with the way the game has changed, despite being elite as a rebounder, and rim defender, those characteristics don’t hold nearly as much value if you’re not able to stretch the floor for better spacing. No doubt Dok is more comfortable as an offensive player than he was as a freshman, but he’s never really developed the ability to hit a face up jump shot. This makes his only value on offense strictly around the rim. His projected failure to draw his defender away from the hoop will allow defenses to sag off and contend the rim easier. His lack of improvement as a free throw shooter doesn’t exactly paint a trajectory of developing even a consistent 15 footer over the next few years. Udoka shot just 44% from the free throw stripe as a senior, and that was a career high. He is also not a naturally quick lateral defender. His focus on conditioning has certainly allowed him to improve, but guarding face up bigs one on one in the NBA often 20-25 feet away from the basket could make him an easier target to blow past, or exploit by a stretch 5 with three point range.Still very raw in terms of skillset. Doesn’t provide much outside the paint. Can improve his post-game and footwork. Can improve his face up game and free throw shooting … Foul prone. Uses hands too much on defense and can develop a better understanding of defensive positioning … Even though his size and length stand out even at the highest levels, he will need to add more to his offensive game. He gets by with simply catching and finishing at the high school level … Needs to improve conditioning, gets winded throughout the game. Not very effective when he’s the last one up the court …","Azubuike stands out with his size, strength, and athleticism. Still raw in his development, he has the opportunity to make an impact at Kansas, where he will spend a minimum of two years due to his listed age. Azubuike played in the McDonald’s All American Game, Jordan Brand Classic, and Nike Hoop Summit.","measured: 6’10.00” barefoot,  6’11.50” in shoes, 9’5.00” standing reach, 259.5 lbs, and 7’7.25” wingspan at the 2020 NBA Combine … All Big 12 Third Team 2017-2018.

He’ll be able to protect the rim, finish pick and rolls and dunk anything within 5 feet of the rim at an elite rate. The question is, will that be good enough to stick in the modern game? His low free throw percentages give pause to project much improvement as a shooter, and he could be a hack target late in games with his current woeful free throw ability. Still, Dok could get a shot as a situational backup to plug in lineups when Andre Drummond, Joel Embiid, and other NBA behemoths come to town, and rack up DNPs when matched against fast paced small ball teams. We saw during the 2020 playoffs that sometimes it’s very valuable to have big bodied rim protectors like JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard on your roster in certain situations. Whether it’s in the 2nd round or by way of a rookie free agent contract, I think Udoka will get a shot. It will just be his ability to adapt the NBA game that will eventually mean the difference between sticking or going overseas to earn his check.Notes: measured: 6’10.00” barefoot,  6’11.50” in shoes, 9’5.00” standing reach, 259.5 lbs, and 7’7.25” wingspan at the 2020 NBA Combine … All Big 12 Third Team 2017-2018.

From magazine covers to being called the next great thing half way through one’s high school career can cause some to lose focus … While he’s very talented, he’s got along ways to go before you could call him a sure fire NBA star … Lacks discipline. He must improve his fundamentals. Dedicate himself to becoming great and not just rely on his natural abilties … He is on a strength program but still needs to add strength to be able to finish off drives and handle physical opponents … Since at times the game is so easy for him, it seems like he lacks effort and motivation … He can be a lazy defender, does not always give great effort going after loose balls and rebounds … Hasn’t proven that he makes his teammates better or that he can take over important games during crunch time … Must develop a killer instinct Must become better at playing off the ball. He’s very good at creating with the ball in his hands, but must learn how to free himself for shots away from the ball … A very good shooter, however the mechanics on his release are a little funky. He may need to adjust his shooting form some … There’s a lot of street to his game, so he’ll likely need to tone it down some to limit turnovers and become a sound college player …",,"Plays AAU ball for Team Final … Similar to Derrick Rose, Evans was raised by his older brothers.",,yes,17.1,0.075,13.1,extremely smooth talented guard incredible wingspan strong mature body proven able play lead guard natural position seems sg still facilitator look score often love playing fast pace doesnt worry play call rather create fly put constant pressure opposing team aggressive style play edge cockiness help succeed thrown thick thing beginning responded nice freshman campaign playing spread offense predicated iso play proven break people dribble get lane vision passing extremely advanced he shown reliable distributor posse deceptive quickness variety crafty move clever footwork allow get defender nice repertoire counter move whether crossover spin behind back dribble traffic whether half court transition steady comfortable dribble even though rarely finish rim great touch around basket us body finesse convert good percentage defensively great hand wingspan allows get deflection high rate,jumpshot shown little progress continues struggle inconsistent shooting shooting woe directly pointed unorthodox release sling ball behind head losing sight completely point release must improve midrange game pullup lack rhythm often leaving balance varying result bit tweener point blazing speed quickness play pg full time lack vertical explosiveness possessed wing player decent athlete unreliable outside shot combination ideal next level rely deceptiveness crafty game dribble get defender always ball hand allowed operate freely able adapt still effective playing ball know use screen work traditional half court set still prone tunnel vision seems forget teammate defensively bit lackadaisical long arm questionable lateral quickness work extremely hard contain ball perimeter 36 tos per game result system control play need learn pick spot better rather attacking traffic getting trouble hyped bit control high school sophomore magazine cover called next great thing half way one high school career cause lose focus he talented he got along way go could call sure fire nba star lack discipline must improve fundamental dedicate becoming great rely natural abilties strength program still need add strength able finish drive handle physical opponent since time game easy seems like lack effort motivation lazy defender always give great effort going loose ball rebound hasnt proven make teammate better take important game crunch time must develop killer instinct must become better playing ball he good creating ball hand must learn free shot away ball good shooter however mechanic release little funky may need adjust shooting form there lot street game hell likely need tone limit turnover become sound college player,,55.96435331,1.15,64.3590063,0.918655179,N,N,N,N,0.9909,1

Gets his feet squared quickly, taking a quick and on balance shot with good elevation and follow through … Has really improved his offensive decision making, shot selection has become very good, and also passes and handles it well without turning the ball over much … Has learned how to move well without the ball, running defenders off screens and staying active … Excellent length, appears to have a wingspan in the neighborhood of 6’9 … Big hands allows him to palm the ball easily … Loves to run the baseline for allyoop dunks … While just an average defender now, his length, speed and athleticism will allow him to become a quality defender in the future if he puts his mind to it …","Brown is a 6’4 SG, making size one of the main detriments to his pro prospects, though his 6’9 wingspan and 8’4 standing reach are both very good … Not a great ball-handler, and can struggle to create for himself when his 1st step doesn’t get him past his matchup … His lack of ball handling is a huge detriment as it limits his ability to utilize his great athletic gifts. He’s also not a good enough jump shooter, currently, to be counted on as a NBA 3 point shooter … Sometimes is forced to settle, and will fall in love with shooting jump shots at times … Though he got a chance to play some PG last season, he doesn’t have the natural instincts for making players better, needed to really be considered a combo guard … Might struggle to defend more physically gifted SG’s in the NBA … Though he continuously improved his shooting throughout his college career, he will need to maintain consistency to further enhance his chances of sticking as an NBA player … Can be a step late on defense, and should improve his off-ball awareness … A bit reliant on teammates to create opportunities for him … May need some time to become a contributor, despite being a senior …Listed at 6’3 making him undersized for the SG position by NBA standards, but he plays bigger. He  has long arms so that combined with his tremendous leaping ability takes some of the concerns about his size away … Struggles when he’s forced to create offense for himself.

Made a huge impact in college from day one … Already looked like he could hang with NBA players the moment he stepped on the floor at in Tucson … Fits today’s NBA extremely well with his ability to knock down outside shots … Scored a majority of his points in the post, generally outclassing opponents with ease, with his huge size/talent differential.

For a player with such elite physical gifts, his shot blocking ability is curiously average (though he seemed to improve as freshman season progressed). He should be able to improve upon this over time, given the proper coaching and desire … Needs to do a better job guarding against the pick and roll. Can sometimes lose his man … Needs to do better as a help defender … Can get flat footed at times … And seemed to look to preserve energy (and fouls) on the defensive end … While capable of scoring at all three levels, jumper (inparticular shot selection) still needs improvement … Tends to shoot it a bit short and at times can rush his shot … Needs to follow through and also look to improve his touch around the basket … Needs to do a better job of commanding the ball inside and establishing position. He’s so big and strong that he will be very difficult to stop from extablishing position at the next level once his strength peaks out and he fully understands utilizing position and getting low … Sometimes is a bit passive and can be lazy at times, though he played with a solid level of energy for the most part throughout his college career …  Needs to do a better job contesting shots on the perimeter … Needs to do a better job scoring in traffic … If crowded, you can bother him and force him to take a difficult shot or turn the ball over … Will need to improve ability to handle double teams …Ayton didn’t make the strides one would hope in his senior year … He did seem more focused towards the end of the season after losing his #1 player in class status nearly universally, but it appeared he got too comfortable sitting at the top spot for too long … He rarely played like he had anything to prove and was complacent offensively … He also turned down the opportunity to compete at the Hoop Summit, an event he had failed to impress at in past years … Tends to settle for jump shots and roams to the perimeter far too often … Can assert himself better as he can go through the motions … Sometimes goes through stretches where he isn’t involved with the offense … Must improve intensity and competitive nature … His jump shot is flat and doesn’t have ideal arc, most of his misses tend to take hard bounces off the rim … Post game is developing but still needs polish, doesn’t have any go to moves … Needs to understand playing aggressive without wearing emotions and picking up frustration fouls … Showed some ability to put the ball on the floor and drive but still resorts to jab stepping and settling for a shot … As an elite level high school bigman, the focus is always to challenge himself as there are plenty of nights where the competition level allows for complacency …Tends to settle for jump shots and roams to the perimeter at times. Can assert himself better as he can go through the motions. Sometimes goes through stretches where he isn’t involved with the offense … His jump shot is flat and doesn’t have ideal arc, most of his misses tend to take hard bounces off the rim … Post game is developing but still needs polish, doesn’t have any go to moves … Needs to understand playing aggressive without wearing emotions and picking up frustration fouls … Can get ahead of himself and mishandle passes … Can play with too much finesse when he has a mismatch and should be more physically dominant with his superior size and athleticism … With his coordination and athleticism I would like to see him put the ball on the floor and drive more, rather than just jab step and shoot … As an elite level high school bigman, the focus is always to challenge himself as there are plenty of nights where the competition level allows for complacency …It remains to be seen whether DeAndre is ready to be this good this early … So many young bigman preps in the internet age have peaked (at 15-16 years of age) and as soon as the hype hit, their development halted (Renardo Sydney, Derrick Caracter, Jeremy Tyler, the list goes on) … How well Ayton and his group of advisors are able to keep the distractions out, and continue his progression towards becoming a pro, will be crucial … The media attention is just beginning and losing the ability to be a kid at such a young age is difficult … It will be important for Ayton to learn how to say no, and develop the right work habits and learn  what to focus on on a day to day basis maximize his abilities … Offensively he still has a lot of room for improvement, he takes advantage of his size and explosiveness, but will need to improve skills … Struggles some against players his size that are stronger than him as he doesn’t have many moves yet in the post … He still doesn’t always impact the game offensively (facing juniors and seniors) but I have no doubt he can become an impact player at the highest level. His current weaknesses are very much related to his immaturity and lack of experience in how to guard post players and avoid stupid fouls …","Incoming Arizona freshman.

Averaged 8.5 (2.5 offensive) rebounds per game over the Nike EYBL in 2018 and 8.3 (2.9 offensive) rebounds per game in 2019 …","The biggest thing holding Barnes back from a higher selection is his inconsistent jump shooting … The willingness to shoot threes is a positive, but his 30% is less than ideal … He is showing that he is more than capable of developing this shot, but inefficiency will hold him back until his perimeter game is a true threat … Not an elite athlete. Lacks great speed in the open floor. Not the most explosive and fluid of athletes, but solid … He does not have the elite ball-handling of the best point-forwards in the NBA or great three-point shooting to make up for it, but he has the tools to expand on these as he has no true faults that cannot be developed … Poor free throw shooting is not a great sign for the development of a consistent jumper as he is shooting just over 50% from the line …Can shoot from outside and can hit shots off the dribble but can improve consistency. Shot 25.7% 3PT% over the Nike EYBL in 2019 … Can also improve as a free throw shooter. Has a wider stance than necessary. Shot 47.4% FT% at the U17 World Cup in 2018.

Very good passer but telegraphs and gets loose at times. Averaged 2.6 turnovers per game over the Nike EYBL in 2019 … High energy but wears his emotions at times …","Barnes is an all-around good player in every way. He has no limitations like the three-point shooting of Ben Simmons or lack of athleticism for a player of his size and weight, which will only encourage teams to take a chance on the young 19-year-old. The development of a three-point shot and maintenance of his imposing stature give him one of the highest ceilings in this year’s draft. The high draft choice of Patrick Williams a season ago, and his subsequent success early in his career, shows that 6th men can still get drafted high and perform at the next level. It also helps that Williams also attended Florida State. The door is open for Barnes to follow right behind Williams and become a lottery pick this summer.","Measured 6’7.0” barefoot, 6’8.0” in shoes 9’0.0” standing reach, 225.4 lbs, and 7’2.75” wingspan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine …Barnes measured 6’6.5 barefoot, 6’8 in shoes, 210 lbs, with a 7’2 wingspan, and a 9’0 standing reach in mid 2018 … Florida State commit … Transferring to Montverde Academy for his senior year … 2019 All-EYBL: Second Team … Won Gold at the U16 Americas Championship in 2017, U17 World Cup in 2018, and U19 World Cup in 2019 …",,yes,15.9,0.106,3.5,versatility power two greatest strength barnes stand 69 attack rim strength speed like others size also listed 227 pound get pushed path easily handle ball well run point well post low bigger defender great passer combo forward versatility offense consistent versatility end barnes lateral quickness strength guard every position court able take ball away two steal per 40 minute play great energy end fo floor modern era point forward see floor well elevates traditional big men size length explosiveness 205 astto ratio third nation among powerfive freshman showcase poise well beyond year play high motor limited minute showed takeover florida end first half efficient scorer inside threepoint line 56 tremendous physique toned arm leg look nba player 19 freakish 72 wingspan big hand help guard player floor impact take game end floor allow get valuable minute early career develop jump shot highriser electric player provide spark time explosive first step allows get around defender ease strength allows maintain extra step get tin attack basket hand kick well high ceiling top shelf potential68 versatile forward good length 72 wingspan 90 standing reach big hand good frame play physical us size advantage well play good energy quick ground finish rim dribble drive either hand big stride over lot ground drive efficient scorer averaged 145 point per game 508 fg nike eybl 2018 181 point per game 512 fg 2019 averaged 98 point per game 76 fg u16 america championship 2017 averaged 95 point per game 489 fg u17 world cup 2018 averaged 97 point per game 542 fg u19 world cup 2019 unselfish read reacts well position good passing court vision especially position pass drive move either hand pass well post halfcourt show potential point forward finished 10th nike eybl 49 assist 2 turnover per game 2018 finished 5th 68 assist 26 turnover per game 2019 averaged 27 assist 09 turnover per game u19 world cup 2019 led pangos allamerican camp 55 assist per game 2019 good mobility versatile fit playing small ballpositionless basketball ability play anywhere floor versatile defensive end well ability guard multiple position show good effort intensity awareness defender active hand rotates block shot well position averaged 12 block per game nike eybl 2018 2019 averaged 24 steal per game u16 america championship 2017 averaged 13 steal per game u17 world cup 2018 averaged 1 steal per game u19 world cup 2019 averaged 11 steal per game nike eybl 2019 good rebounder end start offense grabbing defensive rebound averaged 85 25 offensive rebound per game nike eybl 2018 83 29 offensive rebound per game 2019,biggest thing holding barnes back higher selection inconsistent jump shooting willingness shoot three positive 30 le ideal showing capable developing shot inefficiency hold back perimeter game true threat elite athlete lack great speed open floor explosive fluid athlete solid elite ballhandling best pointforwards nba great threepoint shooting make tool expand true fault developed poor free throw shooting great sign development consistent jumper shooting 50 line shoot outside hit shot dribble improve consistency shot 257 3pt nike eybl 2019 also improve free throw shooter wider stance necessary shot 474 ft u17 world cup 2018 shot 652 ft u19 world cup 2019 shot 675 ft nike eybl 2018 637 ft 2019 room improve expand perimeter game he going play three next level dribble bit high good passer telegraph get loose time averaged 26 turnover per game nike eybl 2019 high energy wear emotion time,barnes allaround good player every way limitation like threepoint shooting ben simmons lack athleticism player size weight encourage team take chance young 19yearold development threepoint shot maintenance imposing stature give one highest ceiling year draft high draft choice patrick williams season ago subsequent success early career show 6th men still get drafted high perform next level also help williams also attended florida state door open barnes follow right behind williams become lottery pick summer,63.58807947,1.15,73.12629139,0.751605503,TBD,TBD,TBD,N,0.9918,1

He essentially played Cade to a standstill over 80 minutes  … Incorporates a solid floater in his game when driving to the basket when bigger players are impeding him from getting to the basket … Showed very solid improvement from his freshman to sophomore year, including raising his 3-point percentage from 30.4% to 41.4% … Bought into Bob Huggins defensive system and really improved, showing equal effort and energy on both ends of the floor … Very active and aggressive hands … Deceptively bigger than he appears. Has a huge wingspan at 6’8.75 on a 6’1 (barefoot) frame … Standing reach at 8’3.5 is nearly that of a prototypical shooting guard … Uses his size well to finish plays with dunks at the rim … Great anticipation on the defensive end, and often gets to the spot before opposing guards do, making it extremely difficult to initiate the offense against him … Excellent 4.9 to 1.8 assist to turnover ratio … Shows the ability to score around the basket and understands how to use his size to post up smaller guards … Smooth, fluid shooting motion … Knocked down over 41.4% from 3 and 81.3% from the FT line … Very shifty with the ball in his hands, and understands how to use fakes and hesitation to create space … Shows the ability to pull up off the dribble and knock down shots effectively … Likes to back down opposing point guards and utilize a turnaround jumper (as he did against standout defender Davion Mitchell) … Very capable ball handler …","McBride is a hard worker, so don’t bet against him. But at this point his feel for the game needs some improvement … Plays a little sporadic as a floor general and will need to learn to control the tempo of the game and become a better facilitator in order to be a full time starting PG at the next level … Not a great ISO guy … As good as he is laterally, he lacks a great burst off the dribble  … First step is good but not elite … Struggles at blowing by defenders and getting to the rim … 2P% just 43%, he shoots a high volume but low productivity … Transition game needs improvement, decision making must improve as well as his ability to finish … Doesn’t have an elite skill at this point, but does a lot of things well … Body type gives the impression that he is less athletic than he really is … Considered by some as more of a combo guard than a point guard … Doesn’t get much lift on his jumper, which may or may not be so terrible as it helps him to get his shot off more quickly, but limits his ability to shoot over bigger guards … Can be too aggressive at times defensively and gamble for steals, instead of playing sound defense on his man … Needs to gain better consistency from game to game … Deferred a little too much at times, instead of taking over the way he was capable. Some of that may have been due to the system and being a team player … Added core strength.

overall skill level … Unselfish, willing passer and does a good job of producing while playing a team-oriented game … Adequate athletic ability, and shows good fluidity and body control … Has a nice jump shot, and is confident with shooting as far out as 25 ft … Able to hit shots off the bounce, off screens and with his feet set at a good rate … Does a good job of making subtle moves off the dribble to get space for his shots, set defenders up looking for ways to score … Attacks closeouts well, and can get to the rim effectively when he uses ball fakes and misdirection moves to get a step on the initial defender … Can operate from mid-range, and seems to like doing so … Has good natural shot-making ability, can make jumpers when contested and delivered often when his team needs a key basket … Doesn’t play a flashy game at all, but is highly fundamental and pretty smart … Never has been a turnover prone player … Despite being a hair short of prototypical size for a SG, he has some ability to play occasional minutes as a lead guard … Good awareness, rarely is a step behind the action or asleep on plays … A very solid and well-coached defensive player, and will be able to defend both guard positions in the NBA … Shows the quick hands to get steals (nearly 2 spg as a Soph.), but also is a sound one-on-one defender who has active feet and textbook stance to effectively slow down penetration … Really looked a lot more consistent as a Soph., after a nagging injury slowed him down some as a Fr. … Pretty tough and competitive, proved he can play through injuries and isn’t one to back down from physical play, which was a must playing in the Big 10 … Has good skill level and is the type of worker that will make him a favorite of his coaches … Leads by example, and doesn’t have the kind of attitude that would be a detriment to a team … Will only be 20 when next season starts, has plenty of time to develop more as a player …Extremely polished, well-rounded player for a college sophomore … Very active hands.  Averaged 1.3 SPG last season … Extremely versatile offensive player who can shoot and drive effectively, shows some combo skills … Harris hit the weights during his freshman year and now has a muscular frame for shooting guard, making him hard to stop in the lane … It also makes him a good rebounder for a guard … Harris is a good shot creator who can accelerate past defenders and finish at the rim … Very effective off the catch-and-shoot … Very good perimeter defender thanks to his lateral quickness, long arms, and instincts.  Does a lot of little things on the defensive end … Excellent transition player who takes the ball to the hoop with force and aggression … Has a good burst, with explosive foot speed off the dribble … Great athlete and a very smooth and fluid player on the court … Deadly three-point shooter who will likely continue to improve as a shooter as he ages … Shot 41% from distance last season … Very hard worker…Good attitude.  Won’t create any negative chemistry issues for his team … Solid length with a 6’6.5 wingspan, helping to make up for his lack of great height … Young for his class, Harris does not turn 19 until September, which gives him even more upside …","Despite having a reputation for being a cerebral, steady player, he took far too many ill advised shots in the ISO game as a sophomore … Harris is not an overly physically gifted prospect, and is going to be smaller than most NBA SG’s he will have to matchup with regularly … Also not overly lengthy (6’6.75 wingspan) or explosive for a SG prospect to compensate completely … Probably not going to factor very much getting to the rim and finishing amongst the trees, pretty vanilla as a creator when looking to slash … Won’t get a lot of finishes above the rim, though he will surprise at times … At times has to settle for tough jumpers because he doesn’t have the handle or speed to consistently break down a defense … Didn’t shoot as well as it may have seemed this past season (35% from 3), and shot more contested shots than he probably should’ve … Size/athleticism kind of limits what he can do on offense at the next level, will need to perfect some moves and use angles to create scoring opportunities … Can be hedged in pick and roll action by tall and athletic bigs, and can struggle with finding ways to clear the corner to score or make passes … Didn’t get much experience as a lead guard at Michigan State, which would’ve helped ease him into a role better in the NBA as a combo guard …Needs to improve as a ball handler.  Often has a loose handle … At 6’4"", is a bit undersized for a shooting guard, his most natural position … Could improve his efficiency inside the three-point line and become more consistent on mid-range jumpers … Not a great off-the-ball player, Harris needs to use screens better to get open for shots … While being a very solid prospect without a sizable basement, his ceiling is not as great as some other prospects …",,"Measured Ht w/ shoes: 6’4, Hgt w/o shoes:  6’3, Wgt: 210, W-Span:  6’6.5, Reach: 8’3.5 at 2012 Nike Hoop Summit … Measured 6’5 (in shoes) 205 lbs, with a 6’7 wingspan at the 2013 Kevin Durant Skills Academy … Named 2012 Indiana Mr. Basketball … Named Big Ten Freshman of the Year last season… Was a star wide receiver on his high school football team, Harris shows a hard-nosed mentality when he is on the court … "," Harris has some clear-cut strengths that will help a team, and there is reason to believe he will be a safe pick in the late-lottery or mid-1st round … He is a sound defender, shooter, and provides toughness and a willingness to do unsung work for his team … He’s also a younger prospect for a 2-year player, who will undoubtedly get better with time … His IQ is good, and is a competitive player with high level intangibles … His size makes him a slight tweener and he’s not overly athletic though, so there will be a few limitations

Shows a high level of intensity when he’s interested …","Greatly needs to improve spot up and off the dribble jump shot, as well as free throw shooting … Needs to become a better ball protector and decision maker … While he has a great feel for the game, added maturity will help in better situational decision making based on time and score … Thrives more in an uptempo game at this point … Needs to strengthen dribbling and finishing with right hand … At times can play overconfident and try to do too much …Wroten can certainly shoot, but it’s unclear how consistent he is, and whether he has range to be a threat as a shooter.

Detractors question his ability to play the point guard position and run a team. Is he a natural point guard? Is he really ready? On the positive side, he’s a heady player who will likely learn as he goes and improve … At this point in his career, he is capable of ocasionally knocking down a long-range shot, but still does most of his damage in the paint … Adding a strong 3-point shot and even a consistent 12-15 foot shot to his game would make Flynn virtually unguardable … Can overdribble at times, but Syracuse’s offense called for him to dominate the ball … Will need to adapt to not having the ball in his hands all the time when he gets to the NBA … Will also have to limit turnovers … Flynn averaged 3.4 TOs per game as a sophomore …While he is fairly strong, he could still put on some more muscle at 511 or under, is undersized for the next level, and could be a mismatch waiting to happen for bigger guards, luckily he is a very good athlete which helps to overcome his lack of ideal size … Playing strictly in a zone focused program will hurt his development defensively due to lack of experience and knowledge of man to man principles … Can get in trouble by trying to do too much and over-dribbling … Tends to play out of the offense and is known to take some ill-advised shots … Settles too often for shooting contested jump shots instead of using his ability to get in the lane His court vision is decent, but needs to keep developing and become a better decision maker … Keeps the ball too long in transition and gets careless with his passes … Although he has decent assist numbers (5.3 per), needs to get better at setting up his teammates, which will help him become a more complete lead guard …",,"Flynn, the Big East co-Rookie of the Year (along with DeJuan Blair) in 2008-2009, enjoyed a sensational sophomore campaign that saw him average 17.4 points and 6.7 assists per game.

Settles for contested shots at times. Can clean up his handle and has room to expand scoring arsenal, especially if he’s selling himself as a scorer at the highest level. Can improve contribution in areas outside of scoring as well; rebounding, playmaking, etc. … Smooth shooting stroke but can improve consistency and has a low set point on shot.

Played heavy minutes as a lead guard with the ball in his hands, but didn’t read the floor or run his teams offense well enough to justify it … Nothing more than a mediocre passer (2.8 : 2.7 A:TO with a 130 usage rate) for a player who was projected as a combo guard in HS … Sometimes Edwards can struggle to contribute when his shots aren’t falling … Had poor efficiency (40% FG and 29% 3FG on 7 attempts a game), partly due to him taking bad shots but also due to usage and the type of extra attention he saw as a Fr … Played on a bad UGA team that was not going to make the NCAA Tournament field in 2020, which is concerning for a prospect in the running to be selected in the top half of the lottery …Can improve as a free throw shooter.

improve midrange scoring, tends to utilize deep threes or getting all the way to the rim … Doesn’t really pick his spots as a midrange shooter or show much of a floater … For someone who can get to the rim and challenge the help defender, he settles for a lot of deep, contested shots … Can learn to incorporate more movement when playing off the ball … Should study players like Steph Curry on how to use constant movement and coming off off of screens to set up shots …",,"Native of Atlanta, Georgia … Incoming Georgia freshman … Scored 12 points in the 2019 McDonald’s All-American Game … Scored

and a NBA ready body at 19 years old, as well as a nice looking jumper, he has the ability to be molded into a formidable scorer and player in the NBA … He struggled defensively and did little to show that he should be viewed as a combo guard in college though, looking like a wing who was more likely to hunt his shot than make his teammates better … In addition, Edwards will have to answer why UGA squad was uncharacteristically bad for a team with a potential lottery pick on their roster … While his effectiveness could improve with less of a burden to carry, it may be concerning to some teams picking in the top part of the lottery that he’s projected as a potential franchise player but struggled so much when asked to lead his college team much like a franchise player would … Still, Edwards

good deal of polish in his overall game and to work on his fundamentals to reach his potential, as well as adding strength to his rail-thin frame which would go a long way to helping him on both

Averaged 2.7 turnovers per game at the U18 Americas Championship. Averaged 3.5 assists to a third most 3.9 turnovers per game over the Nike EYBL in 2018. Finished fifth in turnovers at the NBPA Top 100 in 2017 with 2.2 per game … Good defender and comes away with many steals but tends to gamble a lot … Has room to tighten up his game with consistency and efficiency. Making reads as a full-time point guard may be quite the adjustment as he progresses levels … Has made great strides as a shooter and shot 38.1% 3PT% over the Nike EYBL in 2018 but some of his inefficient games include: 5-15 against Expressions Elite, 3-15 FG & 0-5 3PT against Woodz Elite, 6-18 FG & 1-7 3PT against Team Takeover, 12-33 FG & 2-14 3PT against Seattle Rotary Style, 8-23 FG against BABC  … Older for his class, will turn 19 at the end of his senior year of high school … Doesn’t have standout size and length with a 6’3.5 wingspan … Body isn’t overly strong … High-volume shooter and shot selection can improve. Has improved his shooting and overall, shoots well from outside but still has his games where he’s not connecting and continues to let if fly. Some of his poor shooting percentages over the Nike EYBL in 2018 include: 5-15 against Expressions Elite, 3-15 FG & 0-5 3P against Woodz Elite, 6-18 FG & 1-7 3P against Team Takeover, 12-33 FG & 2-14 3P against Seattle Rotary Style, 8-23 FG against BABC.

upside that will be intriguing for teams picking in the lottery … Anthony comes into this draft after productive Freshman season on an extremely disappointing squad … He showed the scoring punch and talent that made him such a highly touted recruit, and there aren’t many prospects in this class with the type of upside that Anthony possesses … He can score, defend and rebound well at the guard spot and already has good strength for a young backcourt player … His decision making and shot selection are both in need of improvement and will be the main things he will need to sharpen to reach his potential as a player … May be more a scoring guard than a floor general, but in an increasingly position-less NBA, he should still become an essential player given his raw all-around skills and talent, as well as the fact that he has been lauded as a great competitor who has been praised by coaches for his work ethic…Even though UNC had a disappointing season (that was hit hard by injuries, most notably including to Cole Anthony) it was good to see that Anthony generally showed a competitive fire to fight through and try to get the most from himself on a team that was largely ineffective

Great form, accuracy and confidence in his shot: Gets his feet set quickly, has a quick release, good elevation, follow through, and shows range and consistency … Does most of his damage offensively as a spot up shooter … Nearly 50% of his shots come from behind the 3point arch where he is extremely efficient (43% from 3)… Has improved his ability to attack the rim off the bounce and finish with dunks … A +6 or +7 length body type … His 7-foot wingspan allows him to get shots off with ease as well as being a difficult match up on the defensive end … Excels on the defensive end and is disruptive with his great length … Gets in a low defensive stance and covers a lot of ground making it difficult for opponents to get clean looks … Doesn’t gamble for steals and has learned to play sound, fundamental defense after 4 years under Jay Wright at Villanova. He plays the passing lanes well, and is tough to get shots off on due to his length … An extremely efficient overall offensive player shooting (51.6 fg%, 42.9% 3p, and 84.7% ft) … Has improved considerably in his junior season going from a key role player to a star (10 ppg to 18 PPG) on the college level and Villanova’s go-to athletic scorer … Has become known for being a clutch shooter, and seems to elevate his play in big moments … Level headed player who rarely loses his cool … Solid decision maker, 2.1/1.4 a/to rate …","The biggest knock on Bridges is his lack of strength. Not an overly physical player … His 2.8 FTs made on 3.4 attempts show that he doesn’t attack the rim and get to the line a great deal. His FTA/FGA ratio is below 30% at 28.0% … Has worked hard at adding muscle mass, but remains on the thin side at 210 lbs for a player about to turn 22. Could stand to add another 10 lbs, which would help him to finish through contact and play more physical at both ends. Though he may be a player that lacks the natural body type to carry more weight … He would also better utilize his great free throw shooting ability by playing more physical and attacking the rim … Playing alongside one of the nation’s best point guards (Jalen Brunson) for his entire college career has been a huge positive for Bridges, but it has also kept him from having to develop as an isolation player … Has displayed some ability to get to the rim off the bounce and pull up, but remains more of a catch and shoot guy than a driver (96.4% of his 3 pointers come off of assists) … Took some time to break into a star … Red-shirted the 2014-15 season, practicing with the team … Will turn 22 on August 30th, and therefore has maturity but less upside than a number of his fellow draft prospects… Foot speed is solid, especially laterally, but not exceptional … A good leaper but not great with contact and struggles some to finish after contact or rebound in traffic despite his length … Generally goes right, so could improve upon attacking off the dribble using his left hand … Vision and passing a work in progress. Not really a facilitator or a guy that creates open looks for teammates with the drive and dish … More of a lead by example type, could work on being more vocal now that he’s one of the team’s stars …",,"Born and raised in Philadelphia, PA… Has 3 brothers Eric (26), Jack (16) and Korey (13).

1628391,DJ Wilson,2017,1,17,17,Draft,1610612749,Milwaukee,Bucks,MIL,Michigan,College/University,1,DJ,Wilson,,,91.0,Jared Jeffries,"Wilson was a late bloomer this season for Michigan, and he particularly broke out in the NCAA Tournament demonstrating numerous abilities that offer intriguing under the radar NBA potential … He was a key player in turning Michigan’s season around on their way to the Big Ten tournament title and a trip all the way to the Sweet 16 in March, after an up and down regular season … After averaging just 11 points per game in the regular season, he exploded in the tournament, averaging 18.5 points per contest and 3.5 blocks in three games, showing his ability to perform in big moments … At 6’10” and 240 pounds, he is quite a fluid mover and runs the floor very well in transition with long strides … He is also a good cutter without the ball, allowing him to get loose and get easy baskets at the rim … Wilson has good length with a 7’3” wingspan and can finish above the rim in space when receiving passes off of cuts or in transition … Wilson also demonstrates some good perimeter skills for his size, offering potential as a stretch four man in the NBA, which is essential nowadays for modern NBA big men … He has shown to be a dangerous pick and pop threat (37% 3s) and has good mechanics with a quick release and high release point … The defense has to respect his ability to catch and shoot, and he does a good job of attacking closeouts with his footwork and solid ball handling ability to counter when the defense prevents him from catching and shooting … Wilson is a good straight-line driver with both hands, but he likes to drive to his left so he can get to his floater with his right hand … He has good touch on his floater and is able to get his shot off over a lot of defenders with his size and length … Wilson has also shown a respectable face up post game and has an excellent face up jumper off of his inside pivot … He also has excellent footwork in the post and the ability to make jump hooks with either hand … On the defensive end, Wilson is rangy on the perimeter with the ability to keep smaller players in front off the dribble while still being able to contest jumpers with his length. He also has good closing speed on the perimeter and can chase guards off the perimeter due to his fluidity … He also has good lateral quickness and can switch/hedge out on ball screens and still recover … He also offers upside as a rim protector with his length and solid timing once he can refine his defensive awareness … He can also use his length to get in passing lanes and force turnovers off the ball.","Wilson has some outstanding physical tools, but he still needs to learn how to maximize them with consistency … Often times instead of getting all the way to the rim and finishing with his length, he will settle for contested jumpers even when switched on a smaller player … He has a tendency to float on the perimeter when matched up with smaller players instead of posting up and using his size … He has great skill, but he will settle for a lot of contested jumpers early on in the shot clock … Wilson does not have great vision and can improve as a passer out of the post … He has a good handle for his size but will try to do too much at times and over dribble instead of relying on primary ball handlers, which leads to avoidable turnovers … Wilson needs to improve his physicality and toughness in the post, as he does not work hard to get good position against players his size … He also is not a great finisher in traffic and does not get to the free throw line that often (2.3 FTA per 40). He is skilled but he shies away from contact and mostly relies on finesse rather than physicality. He has great upside on the defensive end, but he needs to improve his awareness before he reaches that level … He can be late to hedge out on ball screens and often gets beat off the ball on cuts … He can do a better job of staying low and being in a good stance to maximize his explosiveness … He also does not always see the ball well, which makes him late to come over to the ball side and help out when needed, and he does not always jump to the ball from the weak side … The biggest thing he could improve upon, however, is his production on the glass … In 30 minutes of action last season, he averaged only 5.3 rebounds per game … With his combination of size, length, and athleticism, that number should be much higher … Improving his toughness and learning how to get good position down low will allow him to be much more of a factor here …",,"Given name is DeVante Jaylen Wilson … Born Feb. 19, 1996, in Mt.

He will also need to expand overall perimeter game as many of his possessions ended with him pulling up for a jump shot or a basic straight-line drive … Can commit more to the defensive end … Wears his frustration at times … Good tools but still in the process of putting it all together, which has been the story since he entered high school.

He has the tools to be a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses, with his agility and finesse to go along with his sweet shooting touch. But, he needs to become more consistent with his all-around offensive game, and badly needs to bulk up and fill out his 6’10 frame. He is the prototypical modern-day NBA forward, and can play the small forward, power forward and center positions.

Averaged 2.6 offensive rebounds per game at the U19 World Cup in 2019 … Solid handle for size. Can take rebounds to the other end of the floor … Solid basketball IQ and a willing passer. Good court vision and makes the right pass, always knows where his teammates are. Knows where he’s passing before he catches the ball … Good defensive versatility, guards multiple positions. Picks up ball handlers away from the basket, also defends the post. Moves feet well for his size. Averaged 1.4 steals per game over the Under Armour Association in 2018 … Similar to rebounding, he utilizes his positioning and timing on the defensive end as a help defender. Finished in the top ten in blocked shots with 2.1 per game over the Under Armour Association in 2018 … Vocal … Plays within himself and doesn’t force his impact …","Not a particularly great physical profile (6’9 w/ 6’10 wingspan) or athleticism for a frontcourt player by NBA standards, likely wont be quite as impactful in the low post finishing at the rim compared to college given his only average combination of length and explosiveness…Wont provide much of a shot-blocking presence, mostly just a sound team defender…Quicker, more athletic type PFs can beat him off the bounce in isos, and bigger players can seal and shoot over him…Returned for his Soph. season largely to improve his jumper but saw his 3 point and FT efficiency decrease (from 32% to just 28% from 3 and from 81% to 71% FT), will need to get more consistent after really struggling with it down the stretch this past season…Can be reasonably effective when open, but rushes a bit when contested….Not a natural scorer, so the development of his spot up jump shot would go a long way to maximizing his offensive potential…Very reliant on fundamentals and body positioning, doesnt recover well when beaten or misdirected defensivelyDoesn’t have great length relative to height with a 6’9 wingspan and 8’10 standing reach … Very good mobility, solid athlete and can finish plays above the rim but isn’t incredibly explosive … Currently scores most of his points within the perimeter. Possesses solid shooting mechanics and a high release point but will need to improve as a shooter and expand perimeter game if he wants to maximize his versatility … Has the speed advantage when matched up against big men but lacks ideal size to score against big men in the paint/post. Only shot 14.3% 3PT% over the Under Armour Association in 2018. Didn’t make any threes in his six games at the U18 Americas Championship in 2018.

202322,John Wall,2010,1,1,1,Draft,1610612764,Washington,Wizards,WAS,Kentucky,College/University,1,John,Wall,,,103.0,Derrick Rose/Russell Westbrook," One of the most electrifying players to come out of the college ranks in years … Has an heir of supremacy/confidence that only the truly great ones possess … His speed in the open floor and first step blow by ability is absolutely jaw dropping … His body control and ability to make plays around the rim as well as find teammates with passes while playing at such a break neck speed is what sets him apart. At first you think he’s out of control but he actually makes great decisions while playing at such a fast pace … Fearless attacking the basket off the dribble and seems to find a space in the defense when it isn’t there … His ability to contort his body and finish from all angles around the basket with both hands borders on the absurd … There is a ton of room for growth and improvement, and his style of play (SPEED) is tailor made for the NBA level … Point guards with his size and athleticism are rare, Rose and Westbrook are two of the most athletic lead guards to come along in years, and Wall has some of each of their attributes … Possesses elite athletic ability with unusual length and explosiveness for a point guard … Excellent finisher in transition with both hands and his speed and ability to change direction allows him to get any place he wants on the floor … Pushes the ball up the floor as well as any 6-foot point guard … Can become dominant at both ends of the floor being able to use his length as both a defensive stopper and above average rebounder from the wing … An excellent passer, particularly on the move. Can pick a part a defense setting up teammates for easy scores using his great vision, and creativity … A true floor general, not just an athlete masquerading as a point … Huge hands give him excellent command of the basketball … Good ball handler with either hand … A ball hawk able to rip opposing point guards using his quick hands and feet and long arms. Excellent anticipation on passes contributed to his 1.8 steals per game … Shows leadership ability and will look to become a more vocal leader as he matures … Has a chance to be a merchandising phenomenon with his incredible talent and charisma …Has the size and physical tools to become an incredible player … Not many players at his position have the combination of speed and athleticism that he possesses … At least once or twice a game he will make a brilliant play that shows the amount of potential that he has … He is able to consistently finish above the rim, both in transition and in traffic … He has an extra gear which allows him to turn the corner or to explode by defenders in the open court … Going full speed he is not only faster than anyone else on the court, but he is also very comfortable handling the ball as he is weaving through defenders … Very impressive is his ability to change direction in mid-stride while going full speed … In ISO situations, he is almost impossible to stop because of his great first step as well as the variety of moves that he can use off the dribble … He has good instincts and because he consistently gets into the lane, he is very good at finding teammates when the help defense comes over … His freakish athleticism and extremely long arms make him a serious threat in the passing lanes as well as a weakside shotblocker …","Similar to Derrick Rose entering the league, Wall’s jumpshot is a work in progress … Shooting is the easiest skill to improve upon in the league and Wall’s shooting form is not horrible, but it will require some tweaking and hard work (repetition) in the gym to become a real strength to his game … Wall is not a good set shooter, preferring to create a rhythm using the bounce. His shot lacks great lift and is a little slow to get off. His form and release are decent, but should look to get a little more trajectory … At times it appears Wall is too caught up in impressing instead of focusing on the ultimate goal of winning … More comfortable operating in the open floor than in the half court … Will need to hone his pick and roll skills and half court command of the game … His ability to get into the lane and make plays around the basket in the half court game is more effective than his jump shooting … While possibly even quicker than Rose, he lacks the same body strength and ability to absorb contact. Adding some core body strength would allow him to finish stronger around the rim … Gets careless passing the ball at times. 4 turnovers per game show his lack of ball protection and that his point guard skills are still raw. His 1.6 a/to ratio is solid for a freshman but should be better for such an elite level player … Wall is blessed with such incredible physical gifts that it will be up to him to put in the work to get the most out of his abilities. Too often the most talented players aren’t the ones willing to work the hardest, and at such a young age it’s too early to definitively say whether he ""wants it"" … Competitive player, but will need to develop his killer instinct and ability to take over at the end of games …He is still a very raw player, heavily depending on his athleticism to help him get away with a number of things … As a playmaker he is much more effective in transition, once the tempo slows he struggles making reads and deliver passes … His release is a little slow, but his shooting form is decent, unfortunately at this point he is a non threat from the outside … The shooting inconsistency limits him since people back off, making his driving lanes that much more congested, forcing him to drive into heavy traffic … In pick&roll situations, he is also very shaky because defenders always go under the screen daring him to shoot, which limits the movement and action as well as his passing options … His touch around the rim is unrefined, unless he is dunking he struggles to convert on layups as well as floaters and teardrops … As a defender, he has the length, athleticism and lateral quickness to become a stopper, but at this point he is not very dedicated on that end … He takes plays off and lets inferior players get by him off the dribble … He is very turnover prone, sometimes attempting to throw passes that have no way of finding the target …",A virtual lock for the first pick in the 2010 draft … Led Kentucky to the Elite Eight with just 3 losses all year in his one season in college … Hit a game winning shot with .5 on the clock in his first ever college basketball game … ,,,yes,19.0,0.094,24.1,one electrifying player come college rank year heir supremacyconfidence truly great one posse

1631098,Johnny Davis,2022,1,10,10,Draft,1610612764,Washington,Wizards,WAS,Wisconsin,College/University,1,Johnny,Davis,,,93.0,Kentavious Caldwell-Pope,"A 6’5 190 SG/SF with the athleticism and wiry strong frame that project solidly for an NBA swingman…Runs the court hard and plays with an aggressive, confident mindset that bodes well looking at his potential on both ends at the NBA level…Nice transition player who is tough to contain when he has a head of steam on his way to the basket, being effective at both creating contact to draw fouls (over 6 FT a game on a solid 79% as a Soph.) and using his excellent body control to create space for driving lanes…Promising ability to post up smaller guards, is stronger than his size suggests and is skilled at using his shoulders to create space for turnaround jumpers…Looks good operating at the mid-range level, and is most confident as a shooter from about 15-18 ft…Pretty solid pull up jumper from the mid range…Is a factor in the dribble handoff & pick and roll game too, showing a nice rhythm pulling up off of 2 dribbles…Developing range and shotmaking ability, occasionally made defenders pay as a spot up shooter in the relatively few possessions he played off the ball..Put points on the board in a hurry (19 ppg) often for a team that played at a slow pace all season, and his emergence as a breakthrough player (over 12 ppg and 10 mpg increase from Fr to Soph season) is most impressive because of the amount of defensive attention he received as the year progressed…Projects to become a tough defender as well, where his competitive nature, solid fundamentals, and quick feet make him a nuisance on the ball currently…Impressed many college hoop observers with his willingness to guard the other teams best offensive wings regularly, even though he shouldered so much of an offensive load…Has enough of the twitchy athleticism and instincts needed to be a threat in the passing lanes (1.1 spg for his career), while also having quick reactions when contesting shots and recovering from getting around screens…Reads action instinctively and often diagnoses set plays before they unfold to force turnovers or bad shots…His nose for the ball and aggressiveness also shows itself on the boards, where Davis ranks among the very best in this class regardless of position statistically (8.2 rpg)…Somewhat of a late bloomer who has garnered experience both as a role player and go-to guy early in his prospect development, could be able to hang his hat in some playing roles that would allow him to contribute to an NBA rotation sooner than later while he refines other areas of his game…His massive improvements from his Fr to Soph season show that he is a hard-working player, while his ability to fight through late season injuries to help Wisconsin in conference and NCAA tourny games show his toughness and dedication to his teamShooting guard with solid all around skill and understanding … Davis is capable of driving to the basket with either hand and finishes well around the rim with both hands … Crafty slasher who is deadly in the midrange and showcases a variety of post-scoring moves … Excellent shooter from all three levels with a 44/34/86 shooting split through ten games of his sophomore season … One of, if not the most, improved players in all of college basketball … Averaging 21 points per game for Wisconsin after averaging only 7 as a freshman … Outstanding intangibles and leadership skills … Big shot maker who never backs down from big moments … Great rebounding guard who averages more than 6 boards per game … Improving as a playmaker and passer every game and does a good job limiting turnovers despite his high usage rate (2.3 AST, 1.9 TO) … 34% three-point shooter with four attempts per game. Can knock down threes off the dribble or spotting up, but mostly creates for himself as the primary ball-handler without playmaking guards around him … Can flourish in any role, but his development as a star this year is putting him into lottery discussion … Physical, aggressive defender who can guard 1-4 and disrupt passing lanes off the ball. Currently averaging 1.6 steals per game which is fourth in the Big Ten … Easy to notice his long arms with his disruption and ability to alter and block shots as a guard with nearly a block per game … Moves very well laterally defensively to stay in front of defenders and avoid foul trouble. His fouls per 40 minutes are down from 3.5 to 1.6 this season … Could flourish as a 3-and-D guard early in his career before embracing his current role as a shot-creator with more development and bulkier frame … High potential player who is just starting to scratch the surface of his skill set …","Was asked to be a go-to scorer last season out of necessity, but his aggressive nature overshadowed that he doesnt have the most natural feel for the game offensively…Posted no better than an even A/TO in both of his college seasons (2.1/2.3 this past season), and didnt show the necessary court vision, timing or willingness passing the ball to project well to the primary ball handler role he so often played in college…Shot selection needs to improve (42% FG), he has some struggles getting into the paint against athletic defenders and with finishing at the rim amongst the trees once there, which leads him to try numerous heavily contested shots off the bounce with mixed results (just 46% FG from inside the arc in his career)…Some will point to his late season ankle injury for his explosiveness and efficiency tailing off, and while it did contribute to it, he hasn’t really posted more than average production finishing at the basket even when fully healthy…More rangy than sudden as a slasher, relies more on angles and off balanced defenders to create separation than ball-handling or quickness…At times Davis dribbles too much when creating and is somewhat predictable with his moves, as teams started to successfully anticipate his stepback jumper more and more as the season went along…Can sometimes play into high IQ defenders hands by being overly physical when creating offense, and gets called for fouls using his off arm to create space at times…Had occasional good moments as a 3-point shooter off the dribble, and while his shot isn’t broken he was not an efficient shooter from beyond the arc as a Soph (30% 3FG) and endured a long shooting slump from deep through the last 2 months of the season…Has an average release speed on his shot that makes him project better as an off-ball set shooter from deep, and though he has been solid at it in his career (ex. he shot 38% 3FG on limited attempts as a Fr) he hasnt really been given many chances to show it due to being mostly an on-ball player…Will likely have to use his defense, athleticism and hustle to earn rotational minutes in the early stages of his career while he polishes his offensive skills and learns certain nuances of the game (ie picking his spots and playing to his strengths offensively)Lacks ideal size at 6’5 for a shooting guard, but we’ve seen more players with this size find success in the league in recent years … Doesn’t always create a lot of space for himself on jumpers, but gets away with making contested jumpers against smaller defenders … Solid athlete with good wingspan, however … Doesn’t always appear to create separation against top level athletes. Speed remains one of his biggest question marks … Lacks elite level lateral speed … Needs to continue to improve as a playmaker and not just as a scorer off the dribble … Good, but not great athleticism, which raises concerns again about creating space for himself and also guarding top-level NBA guards …  A/TO ratio is just 1-1, so he can stand to improve his passing, ball handling and decision making to become a more well rounded shooting guard …","Recently emerged as a top player in the nation, which could be a simple hot streak that could fizzle out or a true indication of his development this summer … Though the first half of the season is on pace to be a lottery pick …","Averaging 20.9 PTS, 6.1 REB, 2.3 AST, 1.6 STL as a sophomore at Wisconsin … McDonald’s All-American coming out of high school … 2020 Wisconsin Mr. Basketball … Helped the USA win FIBA U19 World Cup in the Summer of 2021. Averaged 4.1 PTS and 1.7 REB at the World Cup … All-time leading scorer at Central High School (2,158 points)Measured: 6’4.25” barefoot, 6’5.75” in shoes, 8’7.50” standing reach, 196.4 lbs, 6’8.50” wingspan at the 2022 NBA Draft Combine …"," Johnny Davis’ ascension from a bench player as a Fr to a consensus All American contributor as a Soph has him solidified as a high 1st round prospect currently…After winning a gold medal last summer in the FIBA U19 games, Davis used the momentum from that experience to get off to a scorching hot start to the 2021-2022 season that saw him raise his draft stock into Top 5 discussion in the first months of the season after lukewarm discussion about him as a 2022 prospect prior…He became by far the go-to guy offensively on a defensive-minded, methodical Wisconsin squad and put the team on his back & the college hoops world on notice with some huge performances, most notably in a win against 3rd ranked Purdue where Davis had 37 pts and 14 rebs and often matched up against; and got the better of, fellow projected 2022 lottery pick guard Jaden Ivey…Davis is a player with a football background, and it shows in his physical, aggressive nature on the court as well as his willingness to play through nagging injuries…He really competes and his increased production and role shows that he’s willing to work hard…His role at the next level projects to be different than in college, as he seems likely to play more off the ball as a wing at the next level and not as a true primary or secondary playmaker for himself and others…His potential as a prospect is largely tied to his ability to improve his consistency and range as a shooter and working on his shot selection…He seemed to wear down somewhat at the end of this past season due to a combination of injuries, big minutes and true 2-way responsibilities as the main scorer and best defensive player on his team…He could very well improve his efficiency and effectiveness with less of a burden to carry and more talented teammates in the future, and he has the toughness and intangibles to find a niche as a role player until his other offensive skills get more refined …Jorrye Nixon

201964,Victor Claver,2009,1,22,22,Draft,1610612757,Portland,Trail Blazers,POR,Valencia BC (Spain),Other Team/Club,1,Victor,Claver,,,92.0,,"Very strong mentally with impressive physical characteristics as well … A long athletic forward, with good agility and smoothness in the open floor … Has a nice skill set offensively with the ability to face the basket and shoot from outside as well as get by his man to the basket … His combination of height and agility plus offensive polish makes him a very dangerous player … He likes to play open and when he has some space he normally eludes his defenders because usually hes faster … He possesses great confidence as a scorer, with the ability to shoot from distance, especially from the corners where his percentage is best … In the paint he likes to play facing the basket and doesn’t waste dribbles … He attacks the rim with aggressiveness and often finishes with fantastic dunks. Has developing ball handling ability and possesses vision to see the floor and find teammates … he’s adept at recognizing double teams and passing out of them … Similar to Jorge Garbajosa, Claver has a real sense for the game, very smart … Claver’s great length (big wing span) gives him an edge defensively where he’s a solid shot blocker and rebounder … Great leaping ability and a willingness to put his nose in the play make him strong on the boards … Despite his youth, Claver has already played in the highest level in Europe and has shown great maturity. This year he has played his better games in Playoffs 2007 (11.5 ppg, 2 rpg,. 75 bpg) assuming a very rare offensive responsibility for its age. He is a very intelligent player who knows to choose the best option in offensive game …","He needs to add strength although he’s very tough and doesn’t seem to have any issues with his body, just further developing strength as he’s still just going on 19 … He also needs to improve on defensive rebounds … Due to his physical development, he is still in the process of defining his position. During a great part of his career he has played as a small forward, but this year in Pamesa Valencia has played his better matches as a power forward … At this point he lacks the strength to play inside (as a 4) in the NBA and he’s a little slow footed with his foot speed laterally on defense … He’s such a talent he should be able to play both forward positions, but finding his best fit either at the 3 or 4 will be of help to him … He’s generally a better offensive player than defender, he should improve his defense because is a little bit soft and less focused there … As power foward needs to gain muscle and toughness to battle opponents on the boards … Offensively he needs to improve his mid-range shot and his back to the basket game as he often gets too enamored with drifting away from the basket … Having an inside/outside game ala Dirk Nowitki would be a big advantage for him … He is excellent at drawing fouls from his opponents, but his percentage of free throws is just average at 62%, so becoming a better foul shooter will be a great help to him …","In any given draft, after an injury-free season, he could expect to find himself being drafted anywhere between number 15 and 20. Next year I’d expect him to be fully NBA ready also. This 2009 draft class, considered among the less talented in years, probably doesn’t allow him to slip into a beneficial second round (no contract limitations when he goes to the NBA), even after this injury-plagued year. I foresee him to be selected in the late first round now and stay at least one more year in Valencia.",," Despite being a very mature player for his age, Claver needs to gain more experience in Europe, to assume greater responsibilities and to progress technically so he can eventually jump to the NBA with total security.*Alvaro Paricio is a Spanish JournalistYouTube Clip – 5/12/2009",yes,7.5,0.011,-0.4,strong mentally impressive physical characteristic well long athletic forward good agility smoothness open floor nice skill set offensively ability face basket shoot outside well get man basket combination height agility plus offensive polish make dangerous player like play open space normally eludes defender usually he faster posse great confidence scorer ability shoot distance especially corner percentage best paint like play facing basket doesnt waste dribble attack rim aggressiveness often finish fantastic dunk developing ball handling ability posse vision see floor find teammate he adept recognizing double team passing similar jorge garbajosa claver real sense game smart clavers great length big wing span give edge defensively he solid shot blocker rebounder great leaping ability willingness put nose play make strong board despite youth claver already played highest level europe shown great maturity year played better game playoff 2007 115 ppg 2 rpg 75 bpg assuming rare offensive responsibility age intelligent player know choose best option offensive game,need add strength although he tough doesnt seem issue body developing strength he still going 19 also need improve defensive rebound due physical development still process defining position great part career played small forward year pamesa valencia played better match power forward point lack strength play inside 4 nba he little slow footed foot speed laterally defense he talent able play forward position finding best fit either 3 4 help he generally better offensive player defender improve defense little bit soft le focused power foward need gain muscle toughness battle opponent board offensively need improve midrange shot back basket game often get enamored drifting away basket insideoutside game ala dirk nowitki would big advantage excellent drawing foul opponent percentage free throw average 62 becoming better foul shooter great help,given draft injuryfree season could expect find drafted anywhere number 15 20 next year id expect fully nba ready also 2009 draft class considered among le talented year probably doesnt allow slip beneficial second round contract limitation go nba even injuryplagued year foresee selected late first round stay least one year valencia,19.21,2.05,39.3805,-0.352129291,Y,Y,Y,Y,0.9959,1

This is the area of his game he should focus on at both ends of the floor … Budinger needs to improve his ball-handling ability, especially changing directions to be a more effective player off the dribble at the next level … Right now Budinger is much more effective when he spots-up and when shooting the ball coming off screens … He still struggles when creating mid-range shots off the dribble … Defensively he easily gets beat off the dribble due to his poor lateral quickness … Budinger has difficulty guarding stronger and more athletic players than him … Not a very vocal guy, could work on becoming more of a vocal leader … Needs to continue to work on his core strength … Lacks a mean streak.

He’s strong in transition and becoming better in the half court set … Must become a better rebounder, especially on the defensive side … His shot off the dribble has shown solid improvement but can get better … Needs to polish his midrange game to complete his offensive repertoire … Still learning the nuances, with timing and moving without the ball, and freeing himself for shots … Still has a ways to go to be a good man defender Needs to gain strength, although he’s doing a great job with his workouts with professional trainer Trent Suzuki ",," Emerged as one of the top overall players in his class between his junior and senior high school seasons … Budinger possesses a 40 plus inch vertical and is a top 5 volleyball player in the nation, competing for the USA junior national team.

He also does not have a very reliable mid range game or off the dribble jumper … As a projected four man, he will need to be more dependable in this area … It would probably help him to cut some of the motion out of his shot, as he tends to dip the ball all the way to his waist before getting into his release … He is a capable playmaker off the dribble, but his handle is a bit loose … Right now he is limited to mostly just straight line drives and is not great at making multiple moves or changing direction to create for himself … He can improve his feel in the low post, as he does not always do a great job of reacting to how the defense is playing him and seems too often to have his mind made up before he makes his move … He can also improve his shot selection … The three-point shot is not his greatest strength at this stage, but he will occasionally launch deep, low percentage shots from the perimeter, and also drives into traffic out of control too frequently … Kuzma has good vision but does not always play with his head up, which mitigates this ability … He can be forced into turnovers because of this, and he needs to do a better job of making the simple play instead of trying to force the issue … Kuzma was an adequate finisher in college but it will be a big adjustment against NBA length and athleticism; relies more on fluidity than explosiveness and struggles to elevate in traffic … He does not have the requisite size to compensate for his average explosiveness, and he will have to rely on touch and craftiness … He is a capable finisher through contact but struggles more with long defenders, which he will see much more regularly in the NBA; not a great stand still leaper; has good length and mobility at 6’9” but is not as effective defensively as he probably should be … He plays too upright on the perimeter causing him to struggle staying in front of smaller players … He can improve his toughness and develop more of a killer instinct on that end … He can get bullied inside, needs to do a better job of stopping the offensive player’s first move and force him to change directions … He does not show consistent effort when closing out on the perimeter, often too upright and will allow players to put the ball on the floor with his strong hand without showing much resistance … He struggles to contain the ball and usually will not attempt to make a play at the rim when beaten off the dribble … He can also get lost too often when he is off the ball; needs to do a better job of seeing both his man and the ball simultaneously … He can be a bit soft inside, and should be a much better shot blocker with his length … Motivation level remains a question mark.

Runs the floor very well with good agility for his size … Gets off the ground well and finishes plays above the rim with ease. Good transition finisher. Dunks quickly and doesn’t need a gather when catching dump offs, oops, or put backs. Converts offensive rebounds into points … Good footwork in the paint. Good touch within close with either hand in traffic. Scores at different angles around the rim and uses glass when appropriate.

Uses a jump hook and turnaround fade away in the post. Has the foundation as a stretch big and steps out to hit threes on occasions … Doesn’t settle for jump shots or roam the perimeter too often, he consistently goes into the post … Good hands, awareness, and activity level … Good defender. Takes up a lot of space and shrinks the floor with his length. Blocks shots at a good rate without fouling and protects the paint. Quick to close out on the perimeter and block jump shooters. Can hedge when switched onto the perimeter. Averaged 1.6 blocks per game over the Nike EYBL in 2017 and 1.8 blocks per game in 2018 … Unselfish.

Passes well, hits cutters and open shooters when passing out of the post … Good confidence and competitor …","The obvious elephant in the room is that he goes into this draft having played so few minutes of college hoops compared to other 2020 prospects, which makes him a relative unknown in just where he is in his development … While he looked incredibly strong in his first few games, the suspension followed by the decision to shut it down leaves scouts and NBA decision makers with a lot less to work with and the question of just how much his game may have tapered off had he played the entire season … He had a reputation in high school of having a motor that ran hot and cold and there were some questions that many wanted to see answered with a full season of intense play … Wiseman showed glimpses in limited action, but he also showed that he is pretty raw in his skill set and overall basketball IQ at the moment … While he is a potentially game-changing defender, he also seems to be a bit jumpy looking to send shots into the stands, and prone to fakes that lead to fouls or compromises the team’s defensive balance on the court … Whether he can be a true weapon as a scorer at the next level remains in question … He did show decent touch at times with fadaways and mid-range jumpshots … But he remains a real question mark whether he’s a guy that can create legitimate offense for himself  … He’s not very strong or physical right now, will need to put on more weight and get his lower body strength up to bang in the post with the big boys in the NBA … Shot selection can stand to improve, he seems to settle for fade-away shots and jumpers more than you expect for a guy with his physical and athletic traits … His feel for the game seems decent considering his age and development stage, but at times he does appear rushed and mechanical in the low post getting into his moves, and he needs to work on developing his back to the basket game … His ability to defend out on the perimeter is potentially very good for a big guy, but he has some things to learn fundamentally to realize it (ie playing less upright and not relying solely on his length to make up for being out of position) … Doesn’t seem to project to be an elite level shot creator in the post, which means the situation he lands in will matter that much more to his individual success because others will have to create for him, and teach him the nuances of the offensive game …Has potential and still developing as a stretch big man but scoring range is currently limited in this stage of his development, not consistently hitting jump shots or scoring outside the paint. Could use more arc on shot as most of his misses hit the front rim. Only shot 10% (2-20) 3P% over the Nike EYBL. Can improve as a free throw shooter. Shot 62.5% FT% over the Nike EYBL in 2017 and 58.8% FT% in 2018 … Good rebounder but can still be more active on the boards and has room to improve. Averaged 6.9 rebounds per game over the Nike EYBL in 2017 and 6.8 rebounds per game in 2018. The numbers aren’t always on par with his physical ability yet … Can try to block too man shots as help defender, getting out of position and leaving his man open under the basket for an easy put back … Can improve physicality and has room to get stronger in both the upper and lower body. His inability to handle contact against stronger players hinders his finishing in the paint as his body form tends to break with contact …Has potential and still developing as a stretch big man but scoring range is currently limited in this stage of his development. Only shot 10% (2-20) 3P% over the Nike EYBL. Can improve as a free throw shooter.
