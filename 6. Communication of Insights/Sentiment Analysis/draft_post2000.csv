Rarely forces his way to the basket in post ups… Can be prone to forcing up off balance shots against physical opponents … He faces up and settles for mid-range shots more often than he should against mismatches in the post … He has a tendency to turn predominantly to his right shoulder when posting up, which makes him predictable … Should add some moves when posting up, like an up and under … Rarely passes when he is posting up, doesn’t really read quick double teams… Catch and drive game needs some work… Should improve as a passer on the move… He doesn’t always roll hard to the basket in Pick and Roll actions as the screener… At times he tries to do too much and commits turnovers… Has to improve his upper body so that he can absorb contact at the rim better… Doesn’t draw as many fouls as someone would think for a player with his skillset and size… Telegraphs passes at time… He could add a Short Roll to his arsenal after he sets his screens so he could add more options to his game either as a passer, or as a shooter… Doesn’t always box out on defense and depends on his length… Has the tendency to jump to fakes… Foul prone, can commit one or two bad fouls in a game… Can be too focused on the ball while defending on the weakside and lose track of his man … At times he is too far away from his match up, which can cause him problems when defending stretch bigs… Bulky, physical post players can create problems for him …","Victor Wembanyama is probably the most hyped teenager since LeBron James… The secret about him was out way before he became eligible for the 2023 NBA Draft and blew up for 37 points including 7 three pointers against G-League Ignite… The French prospect is a generational talent with huge potential to be impactful from the center position … Scouts who are old enough will inevitably compare him with Ralph Sampson, one of the most unique players in NBA history … Wembanyama is a 7-4 giant who can handle the ball like a perimeter player, with fluid shooting mechanics, good Pick n’ Roll and Pick n’ Pop concepts, who can either Post Up or Face Up the basket and can also protect the rim and hold his ground on the perimeter is he has too… He definitely possesses flaws… His thin frame and injury history are the most glaring concerns… With that said, it’s almost impossible to not think the player that he can be… If Wembanyama stays healthy, then the sky’s the limit for him …",

Capable of bullet passes off the dribble … Good rebounder. Averaged 8.9 rebounds per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 …","Though he has solid athleticism, he lacks great burst and explosiveness … Sometimes has a hard time separating off the dribble and has to take contested shots … Doesn’t get to the rim that much in half court offense … Nothing more than decent as a leaper, and Miller doesn’t convert amongst the trees at a great rate (46 FG% inside the arc) … Needs to add some muscle to his frame; not great at finishing through contact at the moment … At times falls in love with the jump shot; can stand to improve on picking his spots … Could look to add a little more arch to his shot which can be flat … Has moments when aggressive pressure throws him off his game, but he usually does a good job adjusting to the defense … Won’t realize his true defensive potential until he adds the muscle needed to defend bigger PFs … Willing to pass the ball, but isn’t much of a playmaker for others and is more so wired to score … Tough to see him posting up much at the NBA level given his lack of strength currently; can use his size to his advantage down low in college at times but that will be more difficult against longer NBA defenders … Will be 21 years old as a rookie; is older than your typical one-and-done prospect …Lacks scoring efficiency and 3PT consistency. Averaged 12.9 points per game on 43.1% FG% and shot 27.6% 3PT% on 1.9 3PT attempts per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 … Quick with the trigger and settles for outside shots/pull-ups. Lacks slashing ability and wiggle as he usually struggles to get all the way to the rim … Good versatility defensively, but roams a bit at this stage, not really locking in … Not a bad ball-handler, handles well enough to keep the defense honest, but can improve handling in traffic and as mentioned earlier, doesn’t really get by anyone with his dribble. Averaged 2.3 assists to 2.5 turnovers per game over the Nike EYBL in 2021 … Drifts to the perimeter often and can get more movement off the ball. Doesn’t utilize his size advantage around the basket as often as he should … Wears his emotions at times. Can pick up intensity on both ends … Older for his class, will turn 20 around the start of his freshman season …",Incoming Alabama freshman … 2022 McDonald’s All-American … Played in the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic … Played in the 2022 Iverson Classic … 2021 and 2022 Gatorade Player of the Year …,

But the result is pure, he usually gets to his spot and can finish with a nice righty scoop lay up or jump stop into a floater … Especially if he can squeeze an extra few inches out of his shooting range and become proficient at least from the corner threes, it will likely make a big difference for his effectiveness at the next level … Insofar as you trust the stat in this context, his defensive rating remained around 89, which is very good.

Could be too slow to play the four and too short to play as a small-ball five, especially without much to show in the rim protection department … If he can’t bully his way to the basket or win off the dribble, his mid-range game lacks any confidence and often leads to thrown up shots or turnovers at the second level.

Could obviously struggle in these matchups, but won’t be a liability by any measure … Instinctive off-ball defender who generates steals and projects as a solid help-side rim protector from either the 3 or 4 position … Impressive downhill driver who uses his physical frame to earn trips to the foul line, where he shoots at a solid 78% over the last two seasons. Averaged nearly five free throw attempts per game … Impressive playmaker from the wing as well, averaging over three assists per game the past two seasons … Powerful, versatile screener who can pop out for 3-pointers, slip to the basket and finish with strength or create for others in the short roll. Sacramento’s system of ball screens and floor spacing should play to all of Slawson’s strengths as a second-unit playmaker who should gel perfectly with De’Aaron Fox. Proved he can play with a skilled lead guard with Mike Bothwell at Furman … Extremely physical on ball defender, which can lead to foul trouble, but does show he can hang with NBA athletes … Long arms (6’11.75” wingspan) and lateral quickness allow him to recover defensively and block shots from behind even when he loses a step off the dribble … Runs the floor well in transition, sometimes as a ball-handler, always keeping his head up and reading the floor …","The largest gripe with Slawson is the lack of true competition he played against in the Southern Conference and a very old draft age (turns 24 on October 22) … While he looks the part of an elite slasher in his tape, he will find far more difficulty winning off the dribble at the next level. Boasted elite efficiency around the rim, but rarely had to go up against even average shot blockers … Long release to his outside jumper. Almost pushes it at the top of the release instead of going in one fluid motion … Staying on the floor has proved difficult throughout his career as he tends to miss large stretches of the game through foul trouble. Will be difficult to carve out a role if this continues at the next level … Right-hand dominant who is almost guaranteed to spin back to his right if he drives left … Smarter scouting will lead to heavy forces to his left, daring him to make a play going to his weaker side … Turnovers were a consistent problem with more than two per game in his final three seasons … Upside is low with his high draft age and glaring weaknesses from a foul trouble and left hand driving perspective that never improved despite his experience … Many of his assists were system dependent, but his accuracy and timing both in transition and in the half court are admittedly impressive",,"Measured 6′ 6.5” barefoot, 8′ 10” standing reach, 221.6 lbs and a 6′ 11.75” wingspan and a 29 inch standing vertical and a 33′ inch max vertical at the 2023 NBA Draft Combine … Five-year player, four-year starter at Furman … 2021-22 SoCon Defensive Player of the Year … 2022-23 SoCon Player of the Year … Two-time All-SoCon First Team selection … Helped lead the Paladins to their second NCAA Tournament win in school history … Selected 54th overall by the Sacramento Kings in the 2023 NBA Draft …"

Lacks offensive versatility, practically all of his offense came right at the rim or from three – nothing in between … Shot only 30.5% from three in college on 1.7 attempts per game. Most of his offense was the result of a teammate setting him up or from him getting an offensive rebound and putback. His slow, two footed gathers when attacking the rim will allow NBA level players enough time to recover and contest his looks at the rim.

whether filling the lanes for off ball run outs or handling the ball in transition himself … Attentive off the ball and will slip behind defenders for easy cuts to the rim if his match up is late to react/out of position..Finishes well at the basket even when contested amongst the trees, has enough power and touch to score through contact … Makes good things happen when the defense isn’t set but only needs half a step on his man to collapse the paint and get to the rim in the half court with or without a ball screen due to his very quick 1st step and long-striding speed … Ivey is comfortable driving and dishing and in pick and roll situations (especially going right); rewards Purdue’s big front court players with plenty of high percentage looks near the rim off the attention he gets from slashing (3.3 apg as a Soph.) … A really active, quick-handed defender who plays strong on-ball defense at the college level, but is just as adept at jumping passing lanes and causing deflections, likes to flip turnovers into points … Has the athleticism needed to get back in plays after getting beat, capable of making nice chase down blocks … Projects very well to being able to defend anywhere on the perimeter at the NBA level given his physical tools and intensity level, and is among the best overall defenders in this upcoming class … Also a willing rebounder (5.2 rpg) who looks to initiate offense off missed shots..A rapidly improving 3-point shooter (41% 3FG currently as a Soph. on 5 attempts per game, up from just 26% last season) who has made defenses pay when they give him space this season … Ivey possesses decent release speed and touch; has shown flashes of being able to make shots on the move using screens, but especially off the bounce and spotting up with his feet set … Has a couple of rangy step back moves he uses for separation at times to get his shot off … Sporadically uses runners and floaters in the mid-range area, both shots that would be useful to continue to develop considering his play style … Has become a very difficult match up at the college level with his improved shot, as it only adds to the pressure he can put on the defense and puts his matchups at his mercy for blow-bys when closing out on him … Rapidly improved overall scoring efficiency (just under 40% FG last season to 48% on increased volume so far as a Soph.) points to a hard working player who is playing to his strengths while putting in the time to improve his game elsewhere…Has fan favorite traits, given his energy level and highlight reel athleticism, but also will endear himself to coaches and teammates with his contagious effort and solid intangible traits…Gets to the foul line at a decent rate and is an OK FT shooter once he gets there (career 74% on just over 4 FTs per game)","Ivey’s hard charging energy and play style can be projected to be both a gift and a curse, as he can also straddle being too aggressive and being out of control on both ends … Gambles and reaches for steals and will pick up unnecessary fouls or get himself out of proper position, washing himself out of plays at times … High IQ players will undoubtedly be able to have some success using his aggressive approach against him, whether it be stepping in for charges or baiting him into live ball turnovers by getting caught in no man’s land … Offensively, if his speed doesn’t break down the help side level of the defense, he occasionally shows questionable patience and shot selection … Can stand to improve on switching up the pace he plays at more often … Should look to polish his mid-range game, would benefit from adding 1 and 2 dribble pull up shots when chased off the 3-point line …Improved passer but not quite a natural playmaker for others (3.3 apg/2.2 topg); leaves his feet to make passes often, which telegraphs and will allow  defenders the time to recover and close passing angles more quickly … Has some misdirection in his game, but is mostly an average ball-handler who prefers to use his speed and rangy strides to maneuver … Gets low lift on his jumper and shoots a set shot, which is less of a concern for him from the 3-point line given the improvement and shot-making range he’s shown this season, but it will likely make the development of his floaters and runners more imperative at the NBA level … Some consider him a potential point for the next level, but for now he is more of a wing than a true lead guard …",,

He has no limitations like the three-point shooting of Ben Simmons or lack of athleticism for a player of his size and weight, which will only encourage teams to take a chance on the young 19-year-old. The development of a three-point shot and maintenance of his imposing stature give him one of the highest ceilings in this year’s draft. The high draft choice of Patrick Williams a season ago, and his subsequent success early in his career, shows that 6th men can still get drafted high and perform at the next level. It also helps that Williams also attended Florida State.

While more comfortable running the offense, Suggs is capable of playing shooting guard, especially with how well he can move without the basketball and would figure to pair well with an undersized off guard … Defensively, he can play either guard spot, as his length, quickness and strength help him take on larger players … Reads the game at an elite level on both offense and defense … Particularly as a help defender, Suggs excels at understanding what the offense is running, and where to position himself in order to limit the chance of an easy bucket … Smart and decisive on when to double, help or go for steals, and is rarely caught making the wrong play defensively … Also excellent at forcing turnovers, averaging 1.9 steals per game…Is one of the most clutch players in college basketball, most notably draining a buzzer-beating three just steps past half court to defeat UCLA in the Final Four … The former five-star recruit also led the team in assists with 4.5 per game, showcasing his willingness and ability to share the ball …6’5 point guard … Creates offense and scoring opportunities for himself.

Likely a wingspan just an inch or two longer than his height (6’3 – 6’4)","Mitchell has incredible intensity and determination, especially on the defensive end. he is widely considered Baylor’s defensive stopper, and perhaps the top defensive player at the college level … While he figures to be a high level defender at the next level as well, his lack of great length may keep him from being as dominant as at the college level … he is comparable to Ty Lawson in body type and offensive game, and compares to a Marcus Smart on the defensive end, however he’s not as physical or as big as Smart to defend bigs in the paint … Mitchell has put himself in position to be a lottery pick in the 2021 draft …","Measured: 6’0.0” barefoot, 6’1.25” in shoes, 8’0.5” standing reach, 202.4 lbs, 6’4.25” wingspan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine … Native of Hinesville, Georgia … Massive improvement from freshman year at Auburn to Junior year at Baylor, highlighting how much he has worked on his game.

Has the ability to play both forward positions in the future with added strength … Prospect who has one of the highest potentials in the entire class of 2020, due to his potential for skill development as a shooter and defender … Attacks the defensive glass and can initiate fast breaks while doing so with long passes and speed with the ball … Good court vision and passing instincts allow him to create for others … Solid free-throw percentage of 79.6% indicates that there is plenty of potential for his jump shot to improve from the disappointing percentages during his only season at Stanford … Plenty of time to develop as he is only 19 years old until September …6’8 versatile wing … Good length with a 610.5 wingspan … Quick first step and can get to the basket.

Athletic enough to avoid contact and strong enough to finish through contact at the rim … Athleticism and ball-handling allowed him to get to the line over five times per game … Decent defender with unlimited potential thanks to a reported 7′ foot wingspan. Averaged over one steal per game … One of the most active players off the ball on offense who uses his speed and stamina to create easy scoring opportunities with relentless motor … Smooth jumper and elite scorer from inside the three-point arc … Bouncy spark plug who can come off the bench and electrify a team with powerful dunks and finishes in the lane … Can create offense in transition and in the half-court to kickstart an offense … Shot 53% from inside the arc on nearly 10 such shots per game …","Athleticism is better in half court, somewhat limited in the open floor. Not a speed burner … Regressed as a three-point shooter from his freshman year to his sophomore year from 35% to 29%, albeit with double the amount of attempts per game … At times over-confidence gets the better of him, whether it be shot selection or passing … Shooting from distance suffered as he seemed to force shots too often and settle for low percentage looks … Good slasher but lacks great playmaking ability for others and is an average passer at best … He only averaged 1.8 assists per game compared to nearly 3 turnovers … Despite a reported 7’ wingspan, Bouknight rarely made much of an impact defensively and has plenty of room for improvement … Bulking up would allow Bouknight to potentially defend guards and wings … Shot selection will need improvement, which should not be too difficult as his role shifts to an spark-plug scorer off the bench … If he cannot improve as a passer, it will be difficult to allow him to run the offense as a primary ball-handler and his impact will mostly have to come from off the ball … Plays at his best as a primary ball-handler who can attack the basket, but turnovers were a major issue in his college career. High turnover rate at the next level will take away his greatest offensive strength and force him to improve his spot-up shooting … Boom or bust prospect with lots of potential but needs to improve three-point shooting …",,"Measured: 6’3.5” barefoot,  6’4.75” in shoes,  8’5.5” standing reach, 190.0 lbs, 6’8.25” wingspan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine … … 2021 All-Big East First Team … 2020 All-AAC Third Team … 18.7 PTS, 5.7 REB, 1.8 AST, 2.8 TO in final season at UConn … Born in Brooklyn, NY"

While he isn’t a volume scorer at this point, he is very efficient at knocking down the shots he does take … Career 40% 3 point shooter, including two years over 42% from deep … Sets his feet well on catch and shoot opportunities, allowing him to get his shot off quickly and on balance … Doesn’t turn the ball over a lot (although this is partially because he doesn’t look to create a lot) … Is comfortable playing a role and creating space for those around him … Late bloomer … Seems to have untapped athleticism that he doesn’t utilize on a regular basis … Very smooth athlete with the ability to explode and make plays in the open floor … Despite being just 205 lbs, has an excellent frame with broad shoulders and should be able to add 15-20 lbs over time without losing any mobility …","Needs to gain more confidence in his abilities and become a more aggressive athlete … Does not rebound the ball particularly well despite his size advantage … Could use more aggressiveness and assertiveness to become more effective … At times, doesn’t appear to understand what he’s capable of … Does not track the ball well off the rim, resulting in poor positioning for rebounds … Not a big assist guy, doesn’t create many looks for himself or his teammates … Many times doesn’t even look at the rim on the catch, missing opportunities to take an open shot … Often tries to drive laterally, but doesn’t have the handles or quickness for that to be effective for him … Drives looking primarily to pass, particularly to perimeter players spotting up … Should look to play with more energy at all times … Gets pushed around by smaller players on a regular basis … Doesn’t always cut with the urgency needed to get open … Tends to give too much room defensively on the perimeter … Despite giving space, is still prone to getting beat off the bounce by opposing wings because he gets too high of a center of gravity … May need to refine his mechanics to speed up his release on his jumpshot, as he sort of brings the ball down beside his head prior to shooting … Can work on becoming a more vocal leader … Perimeter skills are a work in progress.

Wishful thinking … He is a player that at the moment gives you very little outside of shooting, but the potential is there for him to expand his game considerably … He should benefit from the more open offensive systems at the NBA level and feel emboldened to take more shots early in the shot clock … However, he will need to develop more aspects of his game in order to make the transition … The hope is that he can develop into a 3-and-D player, but so far he has not shown the ability to play the type of defense required to fill that role … He goes long stretches of games in which he doesn’t impact the game in any discernible way … His play style is similar to James Jones or Robert Covington in that he can play a role and knock down jumpshots, but until he can fill out the other parts of his game, it may be hard for him to carve out a significant role at the NBA level …","Measured: 6’7.5”barefoot,  6’9.25” in shoes, 8’9.5” standing reach, 206.0 lbs, 7’0.0” wingpsan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine … Transferred to Virginia for his junior year after two productive seasons at Rice …"

Is able to make a move, keep his dribble, and then capitalize once his defender makes a mistake. Rarely allows defenders to dictate his pace. Uses a good mix of head fakes and ball handling moves to manipulate defenders. Routinely extends plays by continuing to attack defenders to force help side rotations, allowing for his teammates to find openings. Excellent at step back jumpers, especially off the pick and roll – creates a lot of space on his step backs. If defenders stay with his step back, he’s often able to drive to the rim and finish. Always has his eyes up when driving, allowing him to find cutting teammates for easy baskets when the defense helps. Mixes long strides and short choppy steps to create angles to attack. Shoots layups and runners from multiple angles and release points, making it difficult for shot blockers to anticipate his timing. Showed major improvement as a sophomore in getting to the free throw line and shooting a much improved percentage. Only scored in single digits 4 times his sophomore year","Not the explosive athlete you’d hope for at 6’4”. Lacks length with just a 6’4 wingspan …  Has a thin frame that needs to put on muscle at the next level. Passes aren’t always the most accurate – passes don’t always hit teammates in the shooting pocket. This can force teammates to take more difficult shots from time to time. Has a narrow base on his jump shots which projects better for shooting off the bounce as opposed to catch and shoot. Narrow shot base can make it easier for him to be off balance while elevating on his shot. Doesn’t get ideal elevation on his shot, which can lead to easier contests. Can try to do too much, resulting in turnovers. Over-dribbles when met with pressure. Showed a poor second effort at times defensively. Florida’s defense liked to switch 1-4 on ball screens, Mann will have to get used to fighting through/around screens more often. Allows his center of gravity to get too high while defending and can find himself getting beaten by quick guards as a result.","Mann is a skilled scorer and creator with the ball in his hands. He knows how to manipulate defenders and get to his spots on the court. However, he plays much smaller than he is, so even at 6’5”, he’s a one position player as he plays closer to 6’1”. His ability to create his own looks in the pick and roll and find ctters should translate very well to the NBA and he can make an impact right away. He likely needs to make some minor mechanical adjustments to his jumpshot, but he projects to be a solid rotation player early in his career with an opportunity to grow into a major contributor. If he can improve defensively and develop his body, he could end up being a steal in the draft.","Measured: 6’3.25” barefoot, 6’4.25”in shoes,  8’2.5” standing reach, 177.6 lbs,  6’4.0” wingspan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine …"

He shot 12-25 over his last six full games to show that he has the potential to shoot far better than his 30% season average suggest from behind the arc … Finds ways to score even on bad shooting nights by getting to the line and shooting a high percentage of 80% as a freshman … Attacks the glass and rebounds well for a guard with a high vertical and strength going up … Three-point shooting will further unlock his head fake and allow him to do what he does best, which is attacking the rim with physical finishes and pull up in the mid-range … Opportunistic defender who can explode into passing lanes and take the ball away for easy transition dunks. Was able to capitalize on this with 1.5 steals per game at Arizona State … Handles and speed to attack in transition and get to the rim for flashy dunks and layups … Creates space in isolations with creative ball-handling and retreating defenders who are wary of his speed and first step … Young draft age of 19 which will allow him plenty of time to develop and unlock his exceedingly high potential … Possesses great length with a 6’8 wingspan at 6’4 …6’4.5 scoring guard … Good length with a 6’9 wingspan … Good scoring ability and naturally reads the game as a scorer.

He changes pace and direction well, helping to gain separation in the mid range and around the basket … He has a polished post game, and can bully smaller players around the basket if he gets a switch … Smooth, quick jump shot with a high release point, which should equate to continued efficiency in the NBA … Comfortable running the pick and roll, and can score or facilitate using picks … Butler is a solid defender, with tremendous positioning and a high basketball IQ … He is almost always in the right spot, leading to steals, limited dribble penetration and quicker closeouts … Plays defense with his feet rather than his arms … Communicates well on defense, which facilitates better switches ….

He has a little bit of a push to his shot, and though it’s not pure, it is consistent and fairly efficient … Led the Baylor Bears, a team heading for a 1 seed in the tourney to their best season ever, and was team’s leading scorer at 16 ppg … Had solid efficiency at 42.1% FG, 38.1% 3P… Ability to knock down the three ball is one of the more enticing aspects of his game, and he should be able to extend his range (to NBA 3) and find similar success in time … Plays a very controlled offensive game, with very good balance and utilizes hesitation moves to create space … Solid physical frame, able to absorb contact and maintain momentum … Scores well in catch and shoot situations … Mature and focused.

Lacks size and athleticism as a full time 2-guard … Did not even lead the team in assists (Davion Mitchell was the team leader at 3.8 apg) and had just a 3.1 to 2.4 A/TO ratio … Will need to cut down on turnovers, his ball handling appears to be lacking for a point … Athleticism doesn’t really jump out. Not very explosive, making him just average at both creating space for himself and attacking and finishing at the basket … Average overall speed, and doesn’t have the burst to push the ball up the floor and put pressure on the defense … Lack of speed and athleticism makes him below average in transition, and much better suited for the half court, and specifically PnR game … Wingspan reportedly in the neighborhood of 6’4, so he does not possess much length … His lack of speed/ath also limits his ability to score when he’s not afforded a pick. He must improve upon his ability to score when forced to isolate … Struggles to create space in ISO … Despite his size, doesn’t really play big, and rarely makes athletic plays at the rim … Inability to dunk with ease has cost him baskets when he has more athletic opponents trailing him on the break … Should be able to improve upon his 77.5% FT shooting in sophomore year. Shot 79% as a freshman … Solid defensively as he shows focus and determination, though may struggle to contain bigger more athletic 2s as well as smaller speedier points at the next level … Did not get to the line very often, as he shot just 3 FT per game … Despite solid efficiency scoring around the basket in college, may be in for a rude awakening in finding the same success at the next level at scoring on drives with below average athleticism …","Projected as an early-to-mid second rounder for the 2020 NBA draft, Butler has some desirable attributes for the next level and figures to have a chance to catch on as a back up in the league … Plays a steady, smooth game, despite not having flashy, explosive athleticism …","Measured 6’2.25” barefoot, 6’3.75” in shoes 8’2.5” standing reach, 193.0 lbs, and 6’4.0” wingspan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine … Was named the Big 12 Player of the Year, in addition to being named to the All-Big 12 first team and a consensus first-team All American.

(8.1 APG), which is outstanding, and creates a ton of open jump shots and lobs at the rim … Reads help defense very well and delivers accurate, needle-threading passes even against hard hedges from bigs … Occupies double teams and traps by keeping his dribble alive and patiently finding open players … Equally effective passing, slashing and finishing with his left hand as he is with his right … Simply makes everyone’s job easier with the ball in his hands, whether making well timed full-court passes in transition before the defense is set, as a ball-handler in the pick and roll or finding and rewarding cutting teammates for easy scores … Routinely leads teammates in stride with his passes, especially in pick and roll situations, and truly has uncanny timing and court awareness … Has no problem getting into the teeth of the defense with his quick 1st step, and also shows a good command of hesitation moves and crossovers, switching up his pace to lull defenders when necessary … Shows nice footwork in the lane, and the groundwork is there for him to keep improving his in-between game, because he shows flashes of floaters, up-and-unders, and teardrops in his repertoire that will be necessary considering his lack of size … Was a 20 ppg scorer as a Fr., largely out of necessity but you still cant overlook his willingness to score, his adequate finishing ability (for his size) and ability to take advantage of the defense worrying about him driving to dish … The amount of pressure he applies when driving and his surprising willingness to put up shots through contact is heavily reflected in his high FTA rate (8.6 per game), and he converted on a very nice 82% of those attempts, hinting that he has decent shooting touch … Has a great understanding of angles and seeks out contact on his drives, while usually being under control and not getting many offensive fouls…Plays with good energy and has been known to be a student of the game and solid leader … Would not be hard to see Cooper excel in a high octane offensive system that likes to get out an run, has a quiet flair and excitement to his style of play that could easily lead to him being a fan favorite …","Generously listed at 6’1 165, and without much of a frame, vertical athleticism or wingspan to play bigger and taller than he is, Cooper’s diminutive size is a hurdle that will ultimately limit his efficiency as a player at the next level … As stated, he was extremely effective getting into the paint whether with the help of a screen or using his quickness, but he was a subpar finisher amongst the trees once at the rim and struggled against some of the teams with NBA-sized frontline athletes (ie Kentucky and Baylor) … Saw a good amount of his shots around the hoop get blocked when he didn’t draw a foul; and without explosive leaping ability its hard to envision this improving with a step up against NBA competition, making the continued development of his in-between game paramount … While he is clearly a standout and high usage floor general, his turnovers need to be cut down some as well (4 TOPG, 18 per 100 possessions) and he sees a lot of his passes get deflected due to his size but also just occasionally getting ahead of himself forcing passes, whether due to confidence in his ability or pressing the issue because Auburn was struggling down the stretch … His shooting, both spotting up and working off the bounce, is a work in progress as well (22.8% on nearly 5 3PA/game); he has a hitched up, inconsistent form with little elevation and a noticeable backwards lean that led to some ugly misses and doesn’t project to be very effective against closeouts and contests from NBA players … Smaller guards usually have to be much more precise with everything in the NBA to overcome their lack of size, and the time it takes for him to step into his shots plays into bigger, more athletic defenders’ hands … Has OK natural shooting touch and sporadically made defenders pay for diving screens, but not nearly enough and teams will try make him prove he can hit jumpers to slow down the threat of his PnR game … Does not offer much defensively other than occasionally as a pest applying on-ball pressure, and will need to be “masked” often by a good defensive scheme or a bigger bodied back court mate to not be a liability on this end … Has the types of problems you’d associate with smaller guards on this end (can be posted up, washed out of plays by screens, shot over and posted up with ease, gets steamrolled to the basket by bigger ball handlers etc) … Also didn’t do himself favors with effort, fundamentals and defensive focus, as he struggled with containing simple dribble drives, off-ball awareness, getting back into plays after getting beat and sometimes fouling jump shooters as well … Pretty ball-dominant player, and though this is only a minor issue for a PG prospect, he is not likely to make an impact when he doesn’t have the ball and usually can been seen with his feet nailed to the 3 point line …",,Signed with an agent following the 2020-21 season effectively ending his college career … Projected as a late first to early second round pick for the 2021 NBA Draft … Turns 20 on June 11th …

He does not have great length at only 6’2 with an identical wingspan, and he does not make up for it with elite athleticism either … He struggles to match the athleticism of the guards who are his size and the lack of length prevents true contesting ability and the ability to consistently force turnovers and disrupt ball-handlers … Did not finish well in traffic at the college level, which makes it hard to believe he will be able to do so against taller, more physical defenders in the lane in the pros",,"Averaged 15.8 PTS, 3.6 REB, 4.3 AST in his junior season at Creighton … 47/42/77 splits in his college career who should be able to match or improve these shooting percentages with less volume and better looks as a role player rather than a star … 2-time All-Big East player (2nd team in 2020, 1st team in 2021)Measured 6’0.75” barefoot, 6’2.0” in shoes 8’0.0” standing reach, 180.8 lbs, and 6’2.75” wingspan at the 2021 NBA Draft Combine …"

Played heavy minutes as a lead guard with the ball in his hands, but didn’t read the floor or run his teams offense well enough to justify it … Nothing more than a mediocre passer (2.8 : 2.7 A:TO with a 130 usage rate) for a player who was projected as a combo guard in HS … Sometimes Edwards can struggle to contribute when his shots aren’t falling … Had poor efficiency (40% FG and 29% 3FG on 7 attempts a game), partly due to him taking bad shots but also due to usage and the type of extra attention he saw as a Fr … Played on a bad UGA team that was not going to make the NCAA Tournament field in 2020, which is concerning for a prospect in the running to be selected in the top half of the lottery …Can improve as a free throw shooter. Shot just 58.3% FT% over the Under Armour Association in 2018 … Solid playmaker but has room to improve if he’s going to play both guard positions in the NBA … Can work on limiting turnovers … Can improve midrange scoring, tends to utilize deep threes or getting all the way to the rim … Doesn’t really pick his spots as a midrange shooter or show much of a floater … For someone who can get to the rim and challenge the help defender, he settles for a lot of deep, contested shots … Can learn to incorporate more movement when playing off the ball … Should study players like Steph Curry on how to use constant movement and coming off off of screens to set up shots …",,"Native of Atlanta, Georgia … Incoming Georgia freshman … Scored 12 points in the 2019 McDonald’s All-American Game … Scored 21 points in the 2019 Jordan Brand Classic … Played in the 2017 Underclassmen All-American Game …"

Could use more arc on shot as most of his misses hit the front rim. Only shot 10% (2-20) 3P% over the Nike EYBL. Can improve as a free throw shooter.

Shoots it well from deep and has good arc on shot, most of his makes find the bottom of the net. Hits shots from the NBA 3PT line and is a threat to score from literally anywhere in the half court. His jump shot keeps the defense tense and they must guard him tight away from the basket. Good free throw shooter … Gets to the rim off the dribble, using an effective crossover. Good variety and craft as a finisher. Finishes very well in the paint and in traffic, uses glass when appropriate. Good touch on floater … Good ambidexterity, doesn’t hesitate to use either hand dribbling, passing, or finishing. Creative playing style. Very good ballhandler. Creates for himself and others naturally … High basketball IQ. Tremendous instincts, read and reacts, never hesitates or second guesses himself. Supreme self-confidence. Finds the open man when the help defense comes. Tremendous court vision, passing, and playmaking ability, top of his class. Always knows where all four teammates are. Hits teammates in stride and when they’re in position to score. Can run the pick and roll/pop. Throws accurate outlet passes. Pushes the ball after rebounds, steals, and every other opportunity. Thrives in an up-tempo style but can also play in the half court … Good defender when committed both on and off the ball. Has a nose for the ball, gets clean steals when going for double teams. Good anticipation, jumps passing lanes very well to start instant offense. High steal count … Smooth. Quick hands and light on his feet. Good body control as a ballhandler and in the air. Changes speed and direction very well with the ball … Unselfish. Impacts the game without scoring, isn’t ineffective playing alongside other scorers, and compliments the talent around him. Sometimes he’s quick with the trigger but never forces his scoring or hunts for his shots. He tends to add points in bunches as needed or they accumulate as the game progresses … Rebounds very well on both ends for position … A triple-double threat in high school and impacts the game in multiple statistical categories … Nonchalant demeanor, doesn’t rattled under pressure … Has a lot of experience competing against grown men. Younger for his class, will turn 18 in August after high school. A full year younger than quite a few players who played in the high school all-star circuits. In one case, two full years younger …","His overall jump shot lacks any real consistency at the moment, and just like his older brother that can likely be attributed to his highly unorthodox shooting form … His release point is low, somewhere between his chin and his chest, and he shoots a set shot with below average elevation, leading to plenty of flat shots and bad misses whether open or contested (25% from 3point range on 6 attempts per game in 2019) … His mediocre FT shooting (72%) points to him potentially becoming a reasonably efficient shooter in time, but he’s a work in progress …. Ball’s shot selection will also need to improve, as he made just enough deep shots to both keep the defense honest, as well as justify (mostly to himself) that he should at times hoist low percentage shots off the dribble from all over the court … While a pretty good athlete, he is more smooth than dynamic and will only sporadically try to play above the rim in the half court … Should continue to add weight and strength to his improving frame, as he currently gets outmuscled by players with similar size on both ends of the court … Has some experience playing off the ball, but clearly is more effective making plays with the ball in his hands … At times can be turnover prone looking to make the home-run play when a simpler play is available … Doesn’t show any real consistent toughness or effort defensively, mostly interested in jumping passing lanes for run outs or trying to swipe for steals … Rarely stays alert or in a stance for full defensive possessions, has issues fighting through screens and may struggle to defend quicker PGs as a young pro … Seems like the type of player who will be asked to defend the other team’s worst perimeter scorer as he develops, but his defensive versatility (and effectiveness) could improve as he gets stronger and shows more awareness, largely due to his physical tools … There have been whispers that some teams may see Ball’s more nonchalant approach as a player as a questionable investment for a potential franchise player and top draft choice, though his improvement over the past few years seems to point to a determined, hard working young player …Smooth but not an incredibly explosive athlete. Doesn’t get much pop off two feet or in half court situations, especially compared to other guards in his class … Set point on shot is a bit low and he tends to fade a bit at times. Shot selection can improve, he’s a threat to score from anywhere but sometimes pulls up for deep and contested shots that aren’t necessary … Thrives in a fast-paced game, with that can come loose play and high turnovers … Skinny, lacks strength in both the upper and lower body … Can get more action off the ball, tends to drift at times. Roams defensively at times as well, gambling and looking for runout opportunities …","Younger brother of Lonzo Ball … High school career has been a wild ride: from Chino Hills, Lithuania, JBA League, Spire Institute, to the NBL … Has had a lifestyle unlike any other player his age, already a household name with his own TV show and signature sneaker … Freshman on the 2016 undefeated Chino Hills team … Scored 92 points in a game as a high school sophomore … 2019 MVP of The Grind Session and led Spire Institute to the championship game …",On 6/17/19 committed to play for the Illawarra Hawks in Australia’s NBL … Potentially eligible for the 2020 NBA Draft … Younger brother of Lonzo Ball of the New Orleans Pelicans …

Averaged 1.2 blocks per game over the Nike EYBL in 2018 … Younger for his class, won’t turn 18 until August of his freshman year of college. Has the physical tools and upside but has a way to go to tap into it …","There are question marks about his want to as a scorer, and his ceiling as a scorer at the next level … Can he be a 15+ point scorer, does he have the desire to be a bucket getter? … Does not seem to have the instinct to be a high level scorer.

Similar to Lonzo Ball struggles to create in ISO situations as his jumpshot is easily blocked due to a long, unorthodox shooting motion … Will have to prove he can make shots from NBA 3 point range, despite his good percentages in college … Can struggle with physical guards, sometimes can be pestered into turnovers … Not necessarily a natural scorer despite considerable uptick in his scoring in the past year, doesn’t have a bag of tricks to create for himself if he can’t beat you with his quickness at the moment … Though his numbers have improved and he’s the best prospect on Iowa State, his team has struggled this season more than you’d typically associate with a player discussed as a potential high 1st round pick …Though quick and shifty, doesnt possess explosive leaping ability and is mostly a below the rim player …",,

Showed the ability to extend well past the college three and out to NBA three during his sophomore year … Has a clean, concise shooting motion, and gets shots off quickly after setting his feet … Learning some effective tricks to free himself up for shots, including ball fakes, jab steps, and moving without the ball … It’s obvious he has studied some of the game’s greats like Curry and Harden and implemented their ball skills, including step back jumpers to enhance his offensive game … Despite lacking great foot speed, Nesmith shows the ability to defend utilizing long arms, solid technique and effort … Defensive ability is enhanced by his length, maturity, focus and basketball IQ … An extremely prolific three point shooter, at least in his amazing 14 game window, knocking down 4.3 per game (on 8.2 attempts) … Was highly efficient shooting … Prolific scorer. Nesmith went for 34 points twice and topped the 25 point mark four other times in his 14 games … Excellent length with a 6’10 wingspan on the wing … A solid leaper and dunker when he gets an open angle to the rim. His long arms allow him to get well above the rim for finishes … Has a bit of an “old man’s game”. It’s not overly pretty and his legs and movements are a bit rigid, but he’s effective … Has an NBA ready body. Very good upper body strength, showing the ability to finish through contact … Shows some slick ball handling ability to create space for pull ups as well as creating driving opportunities … Steady free throw shooter at 82% in both freshman and sophomore seasons … Proved a better rebounder in freshman season, perhaps showing his ability when focused more on team play than scoring … 3-and-D type of wing prospect …Put up extremely impressive stats as a sophomore with 23 ppg and knocked down an incredibly high volume of shots from behind the arch (made 4.3/8.2 per game) … Undeniably one of the best shooters in the class, shooting 52% from three-point range this past season … Has a good NBA wing frame at 6’6”, 215 lbs. with a 6’10” wingspan … He can catch and shoot as well as anybody in this year’s class, and excels in his off-ball movement … Understands the importance of movement to free himself for looks … Very effective when catching and shooting off-ball screens and uses constant motion to get open … Muscle memory.

Does not create his own shot very well against top athletes and struggles in isolation … Lack of a quick first step makes it tough to get past quality defenders, and also allows opponents to play him close … Average athlete by NBA standards lacking fluidity and explosiveness  … Overall speed and quickness (both laterally and vertically) leaves something to be desired, but can improve … Defense remains a work in progress and something he will need to focus on in order to earn playing time at the next level … Doesn’t crash the boards on the offensive end, but usually isn’t inside the perimeter to begin with … Can make simple passes, but looking to create for others in the half-court isn’t really part of his game … Sometimes panics when double-teamed or rushed, prefers to play at his own pace … Seems to shy away from contact at the rim, preferring to go for an acrobatic lay-up or pull-up… At times, confidence in his jumper can lead to seemingly forced shots with better ones available from his teammates (granted at 52% from three, that is nit picking)… Relies on length rather than quickness on defense, allows quicker players to get by him … Does not block shots, but can step in and alter some … Most weaknesses are easily correctable with the right coaching, but he’s not fully formed yet …","Has some parallels to Buddy Hield, though not the all around scoring threat, lacking the same ability to handle and create off the pull up … A shooting specialist if there ever was one, the modern NBA fits his playing style extremely well and his length gives the potential on defense … He’s arguably the best spot-up shooter in the draft and can provide a floor-spacing three-point threat immediately for any NBA team … His off-ball movement sets him apart from the pack, always moving, using screens and finding the soft spot in the defense to get an open look… Nesmith is elite in his strengths, but limited elsewhere … The lack of ball-handling and playmaking ability caps his potential as a well-rounded player… However, he knows his strengths, taking and making more three-pointers and shots inside the arc this year… Projects to be a specialist, and could turn into one of the better marksmen in the game one day … Should turn into a low-end starter or key role-player thanks to play style, and if he can develop a decent handle and improve lateral quickness he could be much more …","Native of Charleston, SC … Came into college as ESPN’s 69th rated prospect, 64th in 247 Sports … Majored in Human and Organizational Development … Brother Eddie attends Harvard … Will turn 21 on October 16th …Possesses a 6-10 wingspan at 6-6, 215 lbs … Native of Charleston, South Carolina … Was rated 64th nationally coming into college by 247 Sports, 69th by ESPN …"

1628962,Udoka Azubuike,2020,1,27,27,Draft,1610612762,Utah,Jazz,UTA,Kansas,College/University,1,Udoka,Azubuike,,,91,Bismack Biyombo,"Udoka Azubuike’s most obvious strength is pretty hard to miss. He is very big. At 7 feet .25 inches in shoes, and possessing an elite 7’7” wingspan he’s extremely long. Even better, after years in the weight room he’s molded himself into a lean, muscular 260 pound athlete. Dok can hold his own with the biggest and strongest of NBA centers. His size and length give him immediate translatable skills like rebounding and the ability to defend the rim. Azubuike isn’t a stiff either. At the 2020 combine he measured a freakish 37 inch max standing vertical leap, which allowed him to hit the 12’6” mark without any sort of run. After averaging 2.6 blocks per game as a senior at Kansas, Udoka’s size and spring will render him at the very least a plus rim defender in the NBA with the potential to be elite. While not the quickest lateral player his 7’7” wingspan also makes him extremely effective guarding the entire paint area, and extremely effective in one on one post matchups, help and rotational situations in the lane. Even in a more spaced out environment, he would be a major deterrent for offensive players to test their luck in the paint. While not a guy you really want running around by the 3 point line, he’s developed into a solid pick and roll defender too with the ability to effectively switch and stay out of foul trouble. Dok truly was a historic figure in NCAA D1 Hoops. Over four seasons at Kansas he shot .7465% from the field, good for first all time. No, Azubuike isn’t going to impress you with a vast array of post moves, but he is an extremely effective finisher, with the length and girth to be a high level pick and roll target and finisher at the rim at the NBA level. Chances are if he gets the ball in the low post, he’s going to score. Dok upped his rebounding every season at Kansas, and his 10.5 rebounds per game as a senior (3.5 offensive) are good indicators that he’ll be able to collect misses at a good clip at the next level. Over four years he really transformed his body. Dok lost fat, gained muscle and athleticism, and improved endurance which really aided in being in the position to be talked about entering the NBA draft. While not your typical face up big man of 2020, Dok is good enough at what he does (and good enough to be able to do it in the NBA) to be looked at as a potential draft pick or two way player. After seeing how unpolished he was 4 years ago, it’s a testament to his work ethic, which is also another strength6’11 athletic big man … Great size, strength, and aggression. Has great length with a 7’5 wingspan. Takes up a lot of space and holds position against the biggest opponents … Plays physical and likes to bang. It’s common for defenders to get out of the way after he catches it where he wants it and attacks. Needs to be tracked every offensive possession and wears down the man guarding him … Explosive athlete. Gets off the ground very well for a player with his size. Reliable finisher … Good shot blocker. Can serve as an anchor on defense … Very good rebounder on both ends. Holds position well and secures nearly everything he can get his hand on … Shows some touch and a developing jump hook from in close for a solid foundation for a back to the basket game … Embraces his role as a big man. Doesn’t try to step out to the perimeter and play outside his game …","In 1992 we might be talking about a player like Azubuike being picked up in the lottery, but with the way the game has changed, despite being elite as a rebounder, and rim defender, those characteristics don’t hold nearly as much value if you’re not able to stretch the floor for better spacing. No doubt Dok is more comfortable as an offensive player than he was as a freshman, but he’s never really developed the ability to hit a face up jump shot. This makes his only value on offense strictly around the rim. His projected failure to draw his defender away from the hoop will allow defenses to sag off and contend the rim easier. His lack of improvement as a free throw shooter doesn’t exactly paint a trajectory of developing even a consistent 15 footer over the next few years. Udoka shot just 44% from the free throw stripe as a senior, and that was a career high. He is also not a naturally quick lateral defender. His focus on conditioning has certainly allowed him to improve, but guarding face up bigs one on one in the NBA often 20-25 feet away from the basket could make him an easier target to blow past, or exploit by a stretch 5 with three point range.Still very raw in terms of skillset. Doesn’t provide much outside the paint. Can improve his post-game and footwork. Can improve his face up game and free throw shooting … Foul prone. Uses hands too much on defense and can develop a better understanding of defensive positioning … Even though his size and length stand out even at the highest levels, he will need to add more to his offensive game. He gets by with simply catching and finishing at the high school level … Needs to improve conditioning, gets winded throughout the game. Not very effective when he’s the last one up the court …","Azubuike stands out with his size, strength, and athleticism. Still raw in his development, he has the opportunity to make an impact at Kansas, where he will spend a minimum of two years due to his listed age.

Will have questions about his attitude on the court, displayed poor body language and often seen sulking when things didn’t go his way … Possibly even more troubling, McDaniels picked up 5 technical fouls in his Fr season, which is only compounded by the fact that a “tech” in college is also both a personal and team foul … A headlining recruit for a young Washington team, but their season was a big disappointment relative to preseason expectations this past season …Still improving as a three-point shooter.

As a senior, Bane nailed 42% of his three point attempts, and posted a 3 point percentage over 40% in 3 full NCAA seasons. Bane has excellent range on his jumper, and great in spot up situations as well as shooting off the dribble. He’d be an immediate asset to an NBA team spacing the floor at the two spot. At 6’6” Bane possesses a chiseled frame, and high level strength that will be able to handle the rigors of an NBA season, and larger opponents. His 16.6 points as a senior were primarily earned from the perimeter, but Desmond does have the ability to get into the lane and is very good at using his powerful body to take impact and create distance from opposing shot blockers. Nice touch around the rim, and solid ability to adjust in mid air while getting to the hoop. A smart player who had to become more of a distributor during his senior season. He averaged 3.9 assists per game, and was very good at making the “right” pass, and even showed a little bit of ability to run a pick and roll. At 6’6” he was a very good rebounding guard at the college level hauling in 6.3 boards per contest and even notching 4 double doubles with points and rebounds. Defensively he puts in the work, and while not projected as an elite NBA defender, he could do well in a team scheme. He has active hands and stole the ball 1.5 times per game, and is a good vertical athlete who can contest shots.","While Desmond Bane is tall, strong, and a good vertical athlete he’s not really the total package in terms of physicality. Despite being 6’6” tall, he only has a 6’4.25” wingspan, which makes him one of the few players at this level of basketball to have a wingspan shorter than their height. This limits his defensive potential a bit in the NBA. Again, Bane can get off the ground, but lateral quickness isn’t something that is a strong suit for him. He puts forth tons of effort on the court, which will help him, but when trying to get in the lane off the dribble, or trying to guard a quick player, it’s just going to be harder at the NBA level for someone who’s not naturally quick, or particularly fast at changing directions. Does not really project as an NBA player with a lot of positional versatility. Is likely to play the shooting guard on offense, and guard the shooting guard on defense, with maybe a small portion of small forwards. NBA point guards could likely be too quick for him, and a large portion of small forwards could prove to be too long. I don’t view him as a high upside player, but a guy who can definitely play a role in the NBA for a long time.",,"Measured 6’4 without shoes, 6’5 with shoes, 219 lbs, with a 6’4 wingspan and 8’4 standing reach at the June 2017 USA U19 tryouts … All Big 12 Second Team 2018-2019.

Kenyon has developed his overall game tremendously and can now do it all. He can score facing the basket or posting up and is probably the most intimidating presence in the game today. Kenyon often blocks shots at their pinnacle, something Wilt Chamberlain used to do and something very few players are able to do on a regular basis. He takes goaltending calls sometimes but the plays are very effective in sending his opponent a message. Kenyon will be one of the top players selected in June’s NBA draft.",

Plays the game with consistent focus and energy … Coming to the US three years ago and having never played AAU ball, he has always played a structured game … Being late to the game, he never really developed any bad habits … Has an excellent approach to the game and shows the desire to improve through hard work … Has developed his ball handling to the point where he can comfortably bring the ball up the floor, lead the break as well as take bigger opponents off the dribble from the perimeter … Shows good touch around the rim … Plays a very controlled game. Doesn’t gamble for steals or generally get out of control on drives … Really embraced the role of team leader and superstar in his junior year, ramping up his scoring output from 11.6 ppg to 19.6 ppg … Should be a solid scorer at the next level due to his ability to knock down open jumpshots consistently … Solid defender. Does a good job of contesting shots on the perimeter, utilizing his length and anticipation … Good feel for playing in the post. Uses leverage and positioning to his advantage  … Understands how to use his body to create space and shield defenders off in order to get shots off … Strong, athletic body with good muscle tone … Scores well around the rim … Shows solid use of his left hand, both ball handling and finishing with dunks and shots around the rim … Has textbook shooting mechanics, squares up, quick release with follow through … A (decent) 74% free throw shooter and and should be able to improve that over time to be an 80+% FT shooter at the next level … Shows solid leadership skills … Confident personality.

He has moments where he makes shots that look unorthodox or shots that are off by a lot. His lack of feel at times is due to coming to the game late … At times will challenge bigger players and go into the teeth of the defense and force up contested low percentage shots, or get his shot blocked  … Only 7% of his shots were from three point range, though he did hit a very solid clip at 45% … Should look to expand his shooting range (to NBA 3) and make the three point shot a bigger part of his arsenal … Not the most physical of players at the 4 position. Could improve on his rebounding at 6.5 rebound per game … Struggles at times to keep a handle on the ball, allowing it to get poked loose. Should look to strengthen his hands and wrists with weights … Struggles some to limit opponents scoring. At times gets beat off the dribble by small er quicker players …","Hachimura is considered a likely top 10 pick and possible top 5 pick for the 2019 NBA draft by NBA scouts … A bright kid who has picked up the English language and adapted to American culture quickly … Figures to have a substantial endorsement deal after his college career is over as he can become an ambassador to basketball for an entire nation, not to mention potentially boosting the interest of the sport in the surrounding countries in Asia …  Notes:  From Toyama, Japan … Participated for Japan at the 2014 U17 World Championships in Dubai, where he led the tournament in scoring at 22.1 ppg … Also participated at the Jordan Brand Classic’s international game at the Barclays Center in 2015, after committing to Gonzaga … Came to the US for his freshman season in 2016-17 Season, and nearly red-shirted … Became the fifth Japan born player to play Division I NCAA basketball …",

He has a tendency to force the issue and not distribute the ball at times. He has the potential to become an elite 3-point shooter and above average defender in this league, but he must be willing to adapt when his shot is not falling.

A sign of his coach-ability and dedication to improving his game … Finishes well on the move … Also has the ability to one dribble pull up from 10-12 feet if the defense sags off him … Young man with a lot of maturity and composure. Has a calm, confident demeanor and never seems to lose his cool, or get rattled … Has a real presence about him, doesn’t shy away from competition or the limelight and shows a steady demeanor and confidence to handle adversity and tough situations … His feel for the game has shown steady improvement, and he apparently made an excellent decision to return to Maryland for his sophomore year, despite being a likely first rounder as a FR … Excellent 7-plus foot wingspan gives him good length at 6’10 …","Still unproven to some degree against quality competition, though this season he has begun to show what he can do against higher level opponents … Offensive game, while promising is still a work in progress … Still not the most prolific of scorers at 15 ppg after averaging 10 ppg as a freshman in the Big Ten … While he has come a long way in a short time, still must continue to improve upon his feel for the game … At times is slow to recognize double teams and will take the ball into the teeth of defenders, instead of working the ball out for a better look … His ball handling has really grown into a strength, but can still be sloppy and lead to turnovers … Doesn’t have range out past 12-15 feet at this point. While his form and touch suggest he could develop a 3 point shot, to this point he has not been able to add that element to his game … His passing at times can be sloppy, though his 2 assists per game are solid for a big and show that he’s not a black hole on offense … Perhaps just slightly undersized at the center position at 6’10 … Will be 21 (August 15th) before the 2019 NBA Season begins, so his upside is not as intriguing as a true freshman … Not the most formidable shot blocker or rim protector, though he’s solid in this area with a chance to improve. He’ll need to focus more attention to this area of the game …","Has a very bright future with the amount of improvement he’s shown over his two years at Maryland … At times his play evokes memories of Hakeem Olajuwon with his spin moves and baby hooks. He’s still got a long ways to go in terms of offensive polish, and doesn’t have nearly the same dynamic explosiveness and athleticism … But his patience and clever ability to create baskets give his game shades of Hakeem … If he can continue to expand his offensive game and extend his range and shot blocking ability, he can develop into one of the top centers of his generation at the next level … he figures to be the top center available in this year’s draft …","From Luanda, Angola … A top 100 recruit coming out of HS … Participated for Angola at the 2014 U17 Fiba World Championships in Dubai, along with Kansas forward Silvio de Souza  … Played high school ball at Monteverde before transferring to IMG Academy … Began playing basketball at 9 years of age, as his local Luanda club included soccer and basketball, and he quickly dropped soccer and focused on hoops …"

control the tempo of the game … Looks like he will become a point forward in the future … Not very gifted athletically, but has some sneaky athleticim and length that helps him blow by opponents and make athletic finishes … Great size for a wing … Has really bulked up considerably the last few years and has lost some baby fat that he was carrying … Has great feel for the game … Very good ball handler, with a nice crossover and step back dribble on his repertoire… Nice hands that help him in all aspects of the game… Already a very good scorer, he can score in every way possible… When he gets hot is really difficult to stop him… Great shooting mechanics and good looking shooting form… His Pull-up game and shot of dribble are lethal… He is a threat on Spot Up and Catch and Shoot situations… Attacks closeouts and can either go all the way to the hop or stop and shoot… Knows his way around the screens and uses them excellent… Has the ability post-up smaller opponents and punish miss-matches with a variety of moves thanks to his good footwork… Drags bigs away from the basket on switches and tries to exploit any advantage on his favor… Can be effective without the ball in his hands… Good Free Throw shooter… Elite passing skills and court vision… He can pass from anywhere on the floor and everywhere on the floor since he is a really creative passer… Great passer on the move to the weakside, he can already make one hand passes… A true maestro in Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler, he is the dream of every rolling Big… After he receives a pick he can either find the rolling Big, pass to the weakside, go all the way to the basket, or shoot off the dribble… There isn’t a cover he hasn’t faced already, so he is really not surprised anymore against defenses… Great body control and balance on drives… He can penetrate from either side and finish to the basket with strong or finesse lay-ups and even some dunks when he finds room and jump of two feet… Excels in tranistion as a ball handler thanks to his amazing court vision, basketball I.Q and scoring ability… Very good rebounder for his position, especially on the defensive end… Adequate lateral quickness… Doesn’t back down on Defense and tries to make it difficult for his opponent to post him up… Smart help defender who knows where to stand, anticipating plays before happen…","He can be considered magrinally average athlete by NBA standards … Not overly long, more of an average actually…  His first step is slow even for European standrards … Not a very good leaper of one foot, his good jumps come of two feet … Must continue working on his body … He lost some flexibility while he was bulking up … Can be really emotional at times and lose concentration for a few plays… He can depend too much to his instict at times … If he doesn’t have momentum it’s difficult for him to finish plays at the rim… He must improve in changing speeds and pace … His ball handling still needs some polishing, especially with his left hand … Has problems against aggressive ball pressure from smaller, faster opponents … The lack of explosiveness makes it really difficult for him to create his own shoot against great athletes with good wignspan … Isn’t always able to punish switches when he has a versatile Big against him, especially if there are no shooters around him … He has the tendency to over-dribble, trying to find his way around his defender, icing-out teammates momentarily … It’s a questionmark whether he will be able to create consistently at the next level on ISO situations … Finds it difficult to finish in traffic and against elite length … Finishing against contact might be an issue at the next level … Shooting selecion can become a little iffy occasionally with some off balance shoots and long floaters … Can fall in love with his pull-up game and settle too much against switches … Kind of streaky shooter for now … Incosistent 3-point shooter … Must have feet set to shoot well in Catch and Shoot situations … His off the ball game should still improve a little bit more … The fact that he can see angles that no one else can see leads to some extreme passes and, as a consequence, some turnovers… His assist/turnover ratio could be better … He could be more involved on the offensive boards … Doesn’t always box out and depends on instict and position to grab defensive rebounds … He is not always engaged on defense … He should raise his intensity on the defensive end … Doesn’t keep a low stance all the time when he is guarding a ball handler , which makes it easier for his opponent to blow by him … It’s a questionmark who he could guard at the next level, since he has problems against smaller, quicker opponents, but also against athletic wings … Not always physical enough when he is defending in the post … Has problems reading screens on the defensive end … Has been targetted on defense on Pick and Roll situations that force switches to exploit his defensive limitations … Must be more aggressive on defensive close outs …Weaknesses:  His biggest flaw is his lack of quickness and lateral speed, which affects his effectiveness in 1 on 1 defense against more explosive opponents … Furthermore this also limits his offensive effectiveness in ISO situations when he has to rely on his body control and fakes to create the space for the shot or to draw contact … He also needs to work on shot consistency, especially his mechanics and foot positioning … Sometimes he lacks the killer instinct when facing weaker opponents …",,"Son of Saša Dončić, a former professional player. He’s having 5 pts 3 rbs 2 as of average in ACB with 14’ on the court thus far, and a season high of 15+6+4 against Bilbao. 4 points 3 rbs 2 assist in 13’ on the court in Euroleague, with a season high in a losing effort of 15+5 against CSKA Moscow.

when given a straight-line attack opportunity from inside the arc … Willing screener … Fits the mold for ideal big man in today’s NBA … Young for his class, won’t turn 18 until the middle of September of his freshman year …","A late bloomer in regards to his physical frame as he’s still a bit on the thin side … Still very much a kid and will require additional time to fully mature both on and off the floor … Would benefit from developing more muscle/strength for the next level (especially in the upper body) … He’s not overly bouncy or explosive … His overall offensive game is still unpolished despite the promise it has … Jackson has a tendency to get into foul trouble (averaged 8.6 fouls per 100 possessions … A lot of his fouls stem from him being undisciplined on defense … Foul trouble was a main reason why his playing time was diminished throughout his FR season … Needs to work on maintaining his balance as a low-post defender … May need to tweak his shooting mechanics (low release, knuckleball), but still projects as a solid outside shooter … Although he shot a high percentage throughout the season, he did attempt just seven shots per game (what will he do with an expanded role?) … Needs to polish his shooting off the dribble … He was too passive and therefore inconsistent at times … Not an elite below-the-rim finisher … Needs to learn how to move onto the next play (maturity) and not check out the game (mentally) when he makes a bad play or something doesn’t go his way … Lacks passing awareness … Doesn’t look comfortable making decisions with the ball … Remains to be seen if he can develop into a playmaker … His assist-to-turnover ratio left a lot to be desired … Not a shifty enough ball-handler in traffic … Can be a little wild and out of control when he puts the ball on the floor … Does not have a go-to move in the post that he can rely upon … Still developing the footwork that’ll be necessary as a viable low-post threat against bigger and stronger players in the NBA …Low release on his shot, could use more arc … Sometimes rushes it and pushes it from his chest without getting it into the shooting pocket … Shoots quick at times from three and looks off balanced … Tends to lean forward on free throws … Post game is raw. Lacks technique around the basket … Doesn’t handle double teams well … At time he tries to put the ball on the floor in traffic, resulting in turnovers … Solid strength level and frame but will need to get stronger moving forward … Can improve finishing in traffic and handling contact … Would be more dominant if he were to develop more of a mean streak, and play with a little more emotion … May struggle some for playing time as a frehman playing with Nick Ward and Miles Bridges …","Incoming Michigan State freshman … Son of former NBA player, Jaren Jackson … Played in the McDonald’s All American Game, Jordan Brand Classic, and Nike Hoop Summit (13 points and seven rebounds) … Transferred to La Lumiere (29-1) for his senior year, leading them to win the Dick’s National Championship, averaging 15.7 points and eight rebounds in the tournament … Averaged 15.7 points and seven rebounds over the Nike EYBL … Won a gold medal with the 2016 USA Basketball Men’s U17 World Championship Team.

Plays well in traffic and through contact … Lateral quickness is good and gives hope of him transitioning to a full time SF …","Bridges is not a great ball handler and can get sloppy with his dribble in the half court … He does not project as a primary ball handler or shot creator at the next level and is more of a one or two dribble player instead of a playmaker. Bridges is listed by Michigan State as 6-7, but his last official measurements had him at 6-6 with a 6-9 wingspan … The lack of height makes him undersized as a small forward and well undersized at the 4 … He also does not have ideal length, which may hinder his ability to be as disruptive as a defender in the NBA against longer and more athletic players … Despite his explosiveness, he does not get great lift on his jumper, which will generate questions about whether he will consistently be able to get his shot off against longer defenders in the NBA … Bridges is also somewhat limited by his lack of a pull-up jumper and mid-range game … The likelihood Bridges will develop into an offensive focal point who can create consistently for himself and others seems low … It’s not a role he played in either season for the Spartans, and most future wing creators tend to show flashes of this at some point in college …""Classic tweener"" … His NBA position remains a big question mark as he is severely underzied for the post and doesn’t have polished perimeter skills at this point … His shooting has drastically improved in the past year but he still doesn’t shoot with consistency yet … Has a low release and doesn’t exhibit a fluid shooting form … He usually shoots from three or gets all the way to the rim, his midrange game will need to improve moving forward … Needs to improve ball handling ability and overall perimeter skills … More effective in catch and shoot than pulling up … Undersized for a player that spends a majority of time in the paint but shows potential to guard multiple positions … Has some ball handling ability, but it’s a high dribble that must be tightened and proven against real competition … Relies on superior strength and athleticism … Creating offense will be much more difficult at the next level …","Bridges has shown improvement each year, continuing to step up as his role increased.

shooting stroke and solid ability to attack the rim … Underrated athlete with a 40.5 inch vertical (measured at Combine) … Was Duke’s big late game hero in their last NCAA title three years ago … What can’t be taken away from Allen is his career production and his willingness to sacrifice for his team … As a player, Allen is a streaky guy who can score points in chunks from the perimeter when he’s dialed in … At his best he is a knockdown shooter from distance, capable of catching fire. especially if he’s not accounted for … Looks to maneuver around hard closeouts … He has the ability to put the ball on the floor and create some offense, and is pretty good at scoring on the move without the ball too … Solid leaper who is capable of playing above the rim in space, and with adequate body control … Has some good natural ability, and when focused he can shoot well whether stationary or off a screen or curl, and is relatively comfortable creating for himself and his teammates … Pretty decent pick and roll player with a willingness to feed bigs on their way to the rim … Not a selfish player, will put his body on the line on both ends, and is pretty adept at taking charges … Generally puts in good effort on the court, improved his activity level with each passing season … Had to embrace a “villain” persona, assumed a leadership role on a young team in his last season, and there is something to be said about how he adjusted his mindset and role playing with basically a new cast of players in each of his seasons at Duke … A 80+% FT shooter throughout college career …Allen came to Durham with the reputation of being a knockdown shooter and after an okay freshmen campaign (35 percent from three) is now looking the part as a sophomore (44 percent from three on high volume) … For his career, he holds a 62.4 percent true shooting percentage … Since his breakout game in last year’s NCAA Championship Game, Allen has continued to be an offensive force for Duke … Capable of shooting efficiently in both catch and shoot and off the dribble situations … Given any room to get off a shot it’s likely to find the bottom of the net … Accepted the challenge early in the year of being the Blue Devils go-to guy and has flourished in the role … A leader who plays with both passion and confidence … Plays with great energy and always seems mentally prepared and a step ahead … Creative when driving to the basket, utilizing his big hands to palm the ball … Has put a few unsuspecting defenders on posters … Straight line speed is above average and helps him flourish in transition … Uses his jumping ability to snag rebounds that you would think were out of his range …  Positions himself well to be in the right place for rebounds …  Excellent free throw shooter (85.8 percent for his career) … Willing defender … Understands team defensive concepts … Body shows that he works hard in the weight room to maximize his natural strength …","Will turn 23 in October making him one of the older prospects being considered for this year’s draft … A bit undersized for a SG at 6′ 4"" with a 6′ 7"" wingspan and a 8′ 1"" standing reach, so he has prototype size for a SG that also has experience playing point … His style of attacking the basket and then flailing his arms after meeting contact will not work as well at the next level … Over the course of his career, Allen often proved to be an undisciplined and erratic player … his tripping incidents were a little blown out of proportion by media, however he didn’t make himself any fans with his behavior … Is the type of player that doesn’t seem to always have a short memory, and will compound a bad shooting performance by letting it effect the rest of his game … Sometimes his decision making is questionable … Will take unnecessary risks when looking to create, and has a habit of jumping in the air with nowhere to go as a passer and when finishing at the rim, leading to bad possessions … Does not handle length and athleticism that well, can be smothered when hedged by athletic bigs and struggle to contain dribble penetration when matched up with quicker, more athletic players … Ordinary handles, does not show much creativity with the ball and will not strike fear in the hearts of NBA teams in an isolation set … Has some rigidness to him, tends to play too upright when handling the ball which limits his quickness attacking defenders…Only shot 45% or above from the floor in 1 season in his career (2015-2016), which is concerning …Well-documented history of dirty plays and meltdowns during games, which very likely has been dissected by NBA teams that have interviewed him … His effort is to be commended, but the fact that Duke had to switch to a zone defense to mask the team’s defensive lapses is alarming … Has experience playing as a lead guard, but it is tough to see that translating to the next level considering some of the holes in his game …Was not as effective a player with teammate

His ability to realize it figures to be contigent upon landing with the right organization/coaching staff/surrounding clubhouse … Struggled some against high level opponents, creating some questions whether he can have the same success against similar level athletes. Also has had the benefit of playing alongside a dominant college big in Tyler Davis, making teams unable to focus their top defenders on him a lot of the time …","Williams projects as an athletic, energy guy inside that uses his athleticism to overwhelm less physically gifted players.

come out of college basketball in recent memory … This past season as a junior, he won his second national championship, earned AP Player of the Year honors and the Wooden Award … Brunson started 115 games at one of the top college programs in the country in Villanova and is an NBA-ready guard with great maturity and basketball IQ for the point guard spot … He was highly productive in his final season, averaging 18.9 points and 4.6 assists as a junior while shooting 52.1 percent from the field and 40.8 percent from the three-point line … There are very few questions about Brunson’s leadership/ intensity / and pure basketball skills … He is an outstanding leader on the court and makes everyone around him better … Brunson can score at all three levels and be a quality facilitator of the basketball as well … While lacking elite size and explosiveness for an NBA lead guard, Brunson has the skill and craftiness to somewhat make up for it … He has the full arsenal of moves on offense … He is left-handed, which is already more difficult to guard in and of itself because defenders aren’t as used to guarding them … Brunson also moves without the ball very well and cuts with purpose to look for angles where he might be open to catch a pass in open areas … He is excellent at advancing the ball with a sense of urgency to spark the break … He consistently has his head up early in the backcourt and is willing to skip the ball ahead to the open man in transition … Brunson also has a very strong fundamental game on the defensive end … His footwork is very good … He understands how to use his body … He is willing to play with physicality … He anticipates, sees the floor and understands how to play in the team defensive concept … With all of that said, Brunson will still have to prove that he can keep NBA point guards in front of him … He also protects the ball by shielding it with his body and by using his strength … Brunson plays with a steady pace, changes gears and directions very well and creates space by initiating contact, all of which helps when penetrating the defense to score or kick to an open teammate … He has very good court vision and the instincts to see and deliver pinpoint cross-court passes or cunning bounce passes to open cutters … Brunson’s strength and decisiveness allows him to finish effectively around the rim, too, and he makes use of jab-steps and pump-fakes regularly, often times making strong and creative drives to the rim while staying low to the ground before taking off and finishing the play when he’s created the right angle … Brunson is comfortable finishing with either hand and is crafty in transition … He regularly utilizes Euro-steps and other advanced footwork moves while attacking from smart angles to get a high percentage shot off …","The defensive end is where the most questions will arise for Brunson … In today’s NBA, most teams prefer to play lineups that are extremely versatile and switchable on the defensive end … It is far too easy for teams to force switches and get the match-ups they want … Brunson could be a liability in this regard if things go poorly … To be even more clear, Brunson projects as a player who can only defend one position, the point guard position, and it is not 100 percent clear that Brunson would be successful defending starting NBA point guards … The fact is that most players Brunson defends, even without getting switched on to wings or bigs, will be both bigger (longer) and faster than Brunson … While Brunson is an unselfish player, he has a tendency to at times over-dribble while probing the defense, which leads to turnovers … If he can develop a more consistent floater and pull-up mid-range jumper it would help to make decision making simpler while opening up angles to the rim while making him a more versatile scorer … The defensive end is where Brunson must make strides to prove to scouts that he hs what it takes to excel in the NBA … Brunson’s lateral quickness, effort, and willingness to contest shots left a lot to be desired, which is concerning considering his relative pedestrian physical tools … When projecting to the next level it’s

Rarely does he get too sped up or out of control when coming off of ball screens … Carr is a capable playmaker as well and has improved his assist to turnover ratio in his sophomore season … When he keeps his eyes up and does not try to force the issue, he has shown flashes of solid vision … Carr is a good free-throw shooter as well, at nearly 80 percent for the second season in a row … He his size and length, he has some defensive upside as well, despite not being the most explosive vertical athlete … If he can learn to become more active with his hands on the ball, he could be a guy that records a lot of steals and blocks … Carr is also a good rebounder for a lead guard, averaging nearly five boards per game in each of his first two seasons … He is also clearly not afraid of the big moment, as he made some big time shots late in games this season, most notably to beat Ohio State on the road and one to tie it regulation against Minnesota with time winding down …","Carr lacks elite burst off the dribble and does not always explode to the basket when he turns the corner … He is also not the most explosive leaper, which hinders his ability to finish at the rim at times … That will limit his defensive upside in the NBA, as he is not quite big enough to guard NBA two-guards, but he does not have the lateral quickness to consistently stay in front of the dynamic point guards that he will see most nights in the pros … Carr also struggles to score against more physical defenders … Despite having a solid 6-5 foundation to work with, he checks in under 210 pounds and can be pushed off his spots fairly easily, so he will need to add some strength at the next level … There are questions if Carr’s improved shooting may be a bit of a fluke … Mechanically, there are no glaring hitches to his release, but his ball does not have great rotation … Will he be able to get away with this behind a deeper NBA three-point line? The biggest knock on Carr at this stage is his inefficiency … Last year he shot just 37 percent from the field, and while he did improve this season, he still made only a pedestrian 41 percent of his field goal attempts … Carr is much more of a volume scorer, as he had to take a lot of shots from the field in many of his high-scoring games this season … A big reason for that is he does not get to the free-throw line at a high rate … For the second season in a row, Carr attempted just 4.8 free throw attempts per game, which is indicative of his tendency to settle for contested jump shots at times … His shot selection needs some work, as he is a bit ball dominant and often tries to play hero ball instead of running the offense like you typically want from a true point guard … The other major concern with Carr is that, outside of his perimeter shooting, he really has not improved substantially in any area since last year … Obviously, he scored the ball at a higher rate this year, but he made just marginal strides as both a playmaker and a defender … With his limited athleticism, he is going to have to become more than just a volume scorer if he plans to carve out any substantial role for an NBA team …",,"Ranked No. 50 in 2016 ESPN Top 100 recruits…ESPN four-star recruit…ESPN top-rated player from Pennsylvania…Named the 2016 Pennsylvania Player of the Year by USA Today and by PA Sports Writers in 2015 and 2016… Helped lead Roman Catholic to back-to-back PIAA AAAA State Championships with teammates Nazeer Bostick and Lamar Stevens…Played with AAU team ""Team Final”…Named to the Big Ten All-Freshman team, the fourth Nittany Lion to be honored…Started all 33 games en route to honorable mention All-Big Ten… Broke the Nittany Lion freshman assist record…First-Team All-Big Ten selection as sophomore, leading conference in scoring at 19.9 points per game …"

Makes one handed passes with either hand. Quick decision maker, knows where the plays going before receiving the ball. Can make flashy passes in transition or in the half court. Can pin point full court outlet passes to start breaks. Great timing and finds teammates when they’re in position to score … Great ball handler and floor general. Gets where he wants with the ball. High basketball IQ and ideal point guard traits. Brings out the best in his teammates. Can play alongside other great players, isn’t hindered by others taking the shots … Plays even keeled and nonchalant and doesn’t get rattled. Doesn’t force his impact on the game. Can play with the ball in his hands as well as off the ball … Has shooting range out to the three point line … Standout athlete that can finish plays above the rim … Great rebounder on both ends for a guard and impacts the game in multiple statistical categories. Averaged a triple-double for his senior year while going undefeated … Good size and willingness as a defender … Possesses great quickness and shows excellent anticipation …","Ball has an outstanding combination of size, length, and athleticism, but his frame is not filled out yet, and he can struggle with more physical guards at times … This also hinders his ability to consistently get into the paint off the dribble … Wears a leg sleave and his legs appear to be underdeveloped … He has terrific speed but does not possess the quickest first step, which will make it more challenging to put pressure on the defense in the NBA … The biggest knock on Ball at this stage is his inability to consistently create his own offense when things break down … Ball is not great in isolation and generally his pick and roll possessions end up as a passer … He very infrequently used the pick to get into the paint and find his own offense … He also rarely showed signs of any mid-range game or the ability to pull up off the dribble … Ball will likely need to play alongside several other offensive threats to be able to generate his own offense in spurts … Where his awkward shooting mechanics can be exploited is off the dribble … On the one hand, Ball converted on 48.6% of his jumpers off the dribble, a number that was near the top in college basketball … However, rarely did he attempt such shots this season, and most of them were step-back three pointers rather than mid range pull ups … His inability to pull up in the mid-range is a function of his extremely slow shooting mechanics. Ball’s low release point and need to come back across his body certainly seem to factor into his inability to get his jumper off when pulling up off the dribble, and he has almost no in-between game because of it … He will need to develop a somewhat quicker release if he ever wants to be effective in this facet of the game … A lot of Ball’s baskets in the half-court at the rim were assisted, which indicates his ability to move off the ball along with his struggles creating his own shot off the dribble … On the defensive side of the court, Ball is adept at forcing turnovers, but he does not have the overall impact that his physical tools would suggest … Ball struggles at times containing dribble penetration against quicker guards, which was particularly exposed against De’Aaron Fox, who exploded for 39 points against him in the NCAA Tournament … Ball also does not have great awareness when being screened, and he also could show more consistent effort to fight through screens and recover … Ball is an intriguing prospect, but his weaknesses are well documented, and he will need to be surrounded by the right personnel to achieve optimal success … Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounding Ball has nothing to do with his game whatsoever … Some NBA execs view his father, LaVar as a potential problem with his ""over involvement"" and the endless controversial comments he has made over the last few months … The hope is that he will fade into the background and not be too involved with Lonzo’s day to day decision making, and ultimately career. Time will tell …While he can make shots from outside, he has an extremely unorthodox, even ugly, shooting form … Tends to fling the ball from the left side of his face … Has a lot of room to add strength … Good athlete but not incredibly explosive … Played a loose, up tempo style at Chino Hills, will need to work on valuing possessions and making the sound play moving forward …",Ball had a tremendous senior year and high school career as a whole … He leads a talented incoming class for UCLA and has the ability to make an impact early on… Ball’s ability to impact the game without scoring makes him special as a prospect having tied Jacque Vaughn’s McDonald’s All American assist record with 13 in the game.,"Rated the No. 4 player, nationally, in his high school class by ESPN.com and Rivals.com … Named the 2016 CIF Southern Section Open Division Player of the Year … earned 2016 National Player of the Year acclaim from MaxPreps … 2015-16 Male High School Athlete of the Year by MaxPreps, the first recipient of the national award from the state of California … Naismith High School Player of the Year, the Morgan Wootten Player of the Year and the Gatorade State Player of the Year … claimed national Player of the Year honors from USA Today…first-team All-America selection, led Chino Hills to 35-0 record during senior season 2016 CIF State Open Division Championship … set UCLA single-season assists record (274) … First-Team All-America selection"
1628369,Jayson Tatum,2017,1,3,3,Draft,1610612738,Boston,Celtics,BOS,Duke,College/University,1,Jayson,Tatum,,,95,Allan Houston/Danny Granger,"Tatum lived up to lofty expectations placed upon him in his freshman season at Duke, as a result of being heralded as a top-five high-school recruit by virtually every recruiting database … Despite the fact that he missed the first eight games of the season with a foot injury, Tatum developed into an absolute superstar by the end of the season for the Blue Devils, averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 boards, and 2.3 assists per game … Tatum’s NBA potential begins with his prototypical physical profile for a wing player … Standing at 6-8, with a 6-11 wingspan, he has an excellent frame that appears will fill out over time with broad shoulders and great hip mobility for his size … Tatum is a fluid athlete with long strides in the open court and the ability to cover a lot of ground … Another great tool Tatum offers is his ability to play small ball four man in short stretches like he did frequently at Duke. His uncommon skillset is visible right away in his ability to corral defensive rebounds and push the ball up the court effortlessly in transition … He is also great on the fast break off the ball, as he understands how to fill lanes correctly and get himself an easy finish at the rim … His impressively long strides also come to play in the half court, where he can catch from the arc and get all the way to the tin in one dribble … He has great extension when finishing at the rim, and his long wingspan allows him to finish above the rim in space … Tatum’s most intriguing selling point, however, is his highly advanced offensive skillset in the half court, and his NBA ready scoring ability … He is an exceptionally polished scorer for a 19 year old, having the ability to operate from all three levels. He is at his best in the mid-range area where he can create space and shoot over the top of the defense with a high release point on his jumper … He also has outstanding footwork and is never too sped up by the defense … Tatum excels out of the mid-post area as well where he has a variety of moves in his arsenal to beat his man … One of his weaknesses coming out of high school was his below average spot-up shooting from three-point territory … Tatum has improved in this area, as he is most certainly a capable threat from deep, especially off the drive and kick … He has also always been a terrific free-throw shooter (84.9% this season), which provides plenty of promise for further improvement down the road … He is also a good pick and pop threat when needed to play the four … He is particularly strong with his one dribble pull-up jumper going to his left, and he just does a great overall job of attacking hard closeouts with superb footwork … Tatum is probably the best isolation scorer in the draft as well … He utilizes a variety of hesitation pull-ups, jab steps, step backs, crossovers, spins, etc., and he can stop on a dime with ease to get into his shot … He was an absolute nightmare four opposing four men to guard, especially in the mid range, where he used his shiftiness and creativity to get into his mid-range game at will … He also is great at changing speeds in isolation situations to keep his defender off balance and get to the rim … Tatum is a handful to guard when facing up in the post … Defenders have to respect his ability to rise into his jump shot, but he counters this well with an explosive first step off the dribble going to his right … He also employs an occasional Dirk-like fall away jumper that is nearly impossible to guard, and he is great overall feel for where the defender is when posting up … He is still improving as a playmaker, but he has good vision in transition and can see over the top of the defense off the pick and roll … Tatum also has the tools to hold his own on the defensive end in the NBA as well in large part due to his size and length … He slides his feet very well when locked in and uses his length to his advantage (1.4 blocks and 1.6 steals per 40 minutes) … He can cover a lot of ground when closing out on shooters, as he would often run all the way from the ball side of the court and force a difficult shot when the ball was skipped over to his man … He also has the agility to contain quick perimeter players off the dribble and the length to consistently force contested shots … He shows flashes of great instincts and can cover a lot of ground rotating from the weak side to protect the rim … Tatum has good hands off the ball and anticipates passing lanes well … He proved to be a factor on the defensive glass, posting a clip 7.2 d-boards per 40 minutes … His professional approach to the game and work ethic are also noteworthy … He consistently demonstrated the ability to stay calm in pressure situations and come up big in crunch time … His game will fit well in the NBA, and he should be an immediate impact scorer … He is one of the more unique players in this draft and can be considered a low-risk, high-reward player …6’8 smooth and versatile wing prospect … Good size, length, and fluidity for a wing. Uses size and length to shoot over defenders. Good half-court offensive game … Can score and distribute out of the high post … Transitions well from set shooting position into a low driving position and vice versa … Advanced footwork. Uses pivots, step backs, and fade aways … Very good midrange scorer and has begun to extend his shooting range … Can score from multiple spots on the floor … Handles the ball well and has solid court vision. Can create for himself off the dribble … Has shown the ability to facilitate with the ball in his hands over his high school career … Does an excellent job of forcing contact and getting to the foul line … Understands how to play around the rim, can be a mismatch for smaller defenders as well as challenge bigger defenders … High level rebounder for a wing … Strong competitor. Seems to have self awareness and plays for the team … Solid defender, has the tools and ability to guard multiple positions … Shows surprising leadership for a player his age … Doesn’t have any major weaknesses to his game …","One of the first flaws that jump out in Tatum’s game is his inconsistent intensity on defense … At times, he seems to just go through the motions defensively and didn’t demonstrate the competitive desire to lock his man down … In addition, he is an excellent small-ball four on offense, but the same cannot be said about his defensive impact from this position … He is not physical enough to handle bigger players down low, and he needs to add some strength to his lower half … His technique on the perimeter can improve, as his closeouts can be quite lazy, allowing for his man to get by him with little resistance … He is also not the most physical perimeter defender and can do a better job of getting in his stance and containing the dribble … In transition, he does not always sprint back to the paint to help out against penetrating guards in the open court … In an NBA game nowadays that is heavily predicated on up-tempo offense with an abundance of quick guards who love to get in the lane on the break, this is something that he must address … One of the other question marks is that he is still a streaky spot-up shooter … He shot 34.3% from the arc at Duke this past season, which is not bad, but it is not good enough to classify him as an elite knockdown shooter … He is much better as a mid-range shooter and there are questions about if he will be able to adapt to the expanded three-point line in the NBA … Off the catch, his mechanics do not look quite as fluid when he is contested, and he is not always balanced on his release, which can also be a bit quicker … He also must become a more reliable scoring threat off the pick and roll … In these situations, defenders would mostly go under the ball screen, and he frequently would not make them pay with his pull up when this happened … Tatum also was guarded mostly by power forwards, so there are concerns about whether he will be able to create offense as effectively against NBA caliber wing players … His handle can be tightened, as he plays a bit too upright with the ball, making him less explosive … He does not have great burst from a stand still position, which causes him to struggle getting to the rim, and he has trouble finishing against top tier length and athleticism … This forces him to heavily rely on tough floaters and two-point jumpers, which is an inefficient way to score … Tatum can further refine his decision making on offense, as he can be too dependent on isolation offense, even if he excels in these situations … He is not the most comfortable playmaker on the move, and because of his inconsistent spot-up shooting in addition to that; there are questions about his effectiveness off the ball … These few factors will determine how high Tatum’s ceiling is …A high level athlete, but not a jump out of the gym freak … Lacks strength for physical play at higher levels but should add strength in time … Has the ability to make difficult shots but tends to settle for deep contested shots. Fades away at times when it’s unnecessary … Shooting is decent, but in need of improvement. Form doesn’t show any major issues, but is more of a solid shooter than knockdown at this point … Can improve range and consistency as a three point shooter … Can improve finishing in traffic by adding strength … Very long and smooth, but lacks a great burst off the dribble. First step is just average … Tends to over-dribble at times … Likely a 3 as his lack of great foot speed limits his effectiveness off the dribble, and his size and shooting fits the 3 position …","Tatum has been on the radar for a few years and considered one of the top prospects in the talented 2016 high school class.  His commitment along with Harry Giles headlines a talented incoming Duke freshman class and projects to make an impact early on. He was named to the McDonald’s All American Game, Jordan Brand Classic, and Nike Hoop Summit; with a solid showing in each game.","Measured 6’8.25 in shoes, 204 lbs, 6’11 wingspan, and a 8’10.5 standing reach at the 2016 Nike Hoop Summit … 2016 Gatorade National Player of the Year and Gatorade National Male Athlete of the Year … Named to McDonald’s All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic Game … Owns three gold medals as a member of the USA Basketball program: 2015 FIBA U19 World Championship, 2014 FIBA U17 World Championship and 2013 FIBA Americas U16 Championship … Third-Team All-ACC Selection and member of All-ACC Freshman Team …Notes: Measured 6’8 (in shoes) 193 lbs, with a 6’9 wingspan at the 2014 Kevin Durant Skills Academy"

He can get hot from outside but can still add consistency, still has a slight hitch in his shot that causes him to release the ball on the way down … Passionate player but can wear his emotions at times … Older for his grade by quite a bit. Will turn 20 in February of his freshman season …Still has room to tighten up his ball handling, can get sloppy throughout the game … Also has room to become a more consistent jump shooter … While he has no problem breaking down the defense from the perimeter, becoming a consistent scoring threat from outside would do wonders for Jackson’s game … Has a tendency to take plays off or settle when he should be involved with every play … Should post up more when having a guard or smaller wing guarding him … Utilizing his physical tools and natural athleticism to expose mismatches closer to the basket would add another dimension to an already nearly unstoppable player …","Jackson had a big senior season showcasing his elite ability against top competition … He never failed to rise to the occasion … When he gets into attack mode and plays at his best, he can’t be matched … Earned MVP of the McDonald’s All-American Game … As of right now, it is likely he will only be at Kansas for one season as he is the top prospect among the talented 2017 NBA Draft class … His rare combination of elite tools, athleticism, and IQ gives Jackson the potential to be one of the faces of the NBA in the future …Jackson transferred to the newly formed Prolific Prep in Napa, California after spending his first two high school seasons with Detroit Consortium.

He projects to be among the NBA’s most elusive guards from day one … His elite burst and ball handling allow him to create via the pick and roll or isolation (21.2 points per 40 minutes), and he does a good job of drawing contact and getting to the free throw line (7.5 free throw attempts per 40 minutes) … Fox still needs to add more consistency with his shot, but he is a capable mid range shooter off the dribble with sound mechanics … His jumper in the long run is encouraging as he gets great elevation and releases the ball high … When he cannot get all the way to the rim, he utilizes an impressive floater with good touch … He combines his quickness with the ability to drive with either hand, and he does a great job of changing gears with the ball in his hands … He uses a variety of dribble moves and counter moves to freeze his defender from hang dribbles, hesitations, hard crosses, in and outs, etc … Fox also demonstrates great footwork on his crossover into his pull up jump shot, where he is capable of knocking it down if the defense sags off too far … Off the pick and roll, he is an absolute mismatch for big men that occasionally get caught switching on him; he will use hard in and out dribbles that cover a lot of ground to blow by defenders and get to the basket … He can also cover a lot of ground with the dribble and rarely is there any wasted movement with the ball … Despite being taller for a lead guard, he has a low dribble that makes him much more explosive and difficult to contain … He is constantly keeping the defense guessing by playing high to low and slow to fast, which really aids him when his jumper is not working for him … Fox is not an elite facilitator yet, but he has solid vision (5.8 assists per 40 minutes) … His ability to collapse the defense on the drive points towards high upside as a playmaker … He also has the size to see over the top of the defense with an improving pick and roll game as well … Fox has good vision in space and always keeps his head up in transition, showing the ability to deliver accurate passes with either hand to teammates running the floor … Fox has outstanding potential as a defender as well with his size, length, lateral quickness, and instincts … He also has elite reaction time with quick hands and high activity off the ball … At times he will pressure full court and make it very difficult for opposing ball handlers to initiate an offense … He shows great motor in this end of the court as well, as he does en exemplary job of helping off the ball, and still closing out to his man under control when the ball is kicked out. He does an outstanding job of stopping his man’s first move and forcing him to change directions … He anticipates passing lanes very well and has active hands on the ball to force turnovers …6’3 shifty left handed point guard … Good size and length for the position … Explosive athleticism and high skill level. Changes speeds very well. Great lead guard in transition. Pushes the ball at every opportunity and is a blur in the open floor. Elite quickness: quick hands, feet, and great reaction time … Good court vision and passing ability. Great touch on lob passes and floaters. Handles the ball very well … Has the ability to avoid traps and break a press by himself … Has good body control; plays with a lot of creativity and craftiness … Gets where he wants off the dribble and breaks down the defense efficiently … Uses hop steps to get to the middle of the floor and avoids contact. Swift footwork in traffic … Can score from multiple spots on the floor. Very good midrange scorer where he can get to at will. Good pull up jumper … Has range out to three … Rebounds well for a guard … Top notch defender especially on the ball, can rip good ball handlers in one on one situations … Great anticipation in the passing lanes. Great defensive tools moving forward with his length, quickness, and instincts …","The biggest obstacle for Fox in his transition to the NBA is his lack of a consistent jump shot … Fox made just 31% of his pull-up jumpers, and 20% of his spot up attempts in the half court this season, but he connected on a far more respectable 55% and 36% of those attempts respectively in March … When his jumper is not working, his half-court scoring becomes much more limited and the defense can sag off of him, which somewhat negates his elite quickness … One piece of his shot that he could fix is his tendency to flex his elbow too more, creating almost a slingshot-like release … Fox does not have NBA range at this stage and is much more effective inside the arc; he needs to work on being balanced more consistently on his pull-ups … Fox still is learning to find the right balance between scoring and facilitating … He has a tendency to get too sped up when going to the rim and be a little out of control … He does not always anticipate a play well before they happen, and he can work on his timing with passes … He could also work on his timing and patience off the pick and roll, as he can be especially turnover prone in this department … Fox is still young but he will need to add strength and fill out his wiry frame to hold up over time against the bigger guards in the league … He may struggle initially with bigger guards on defense and finishing through contact in the NBA … He has potential to be a lockdown defender, but sometimes he can be a bit too upright on the ball, which mitigates his lateral quickness …Can be a streaky shooter. More of a scorer than consistent shooter right now … Has a slight frame. Very light at 175 pounds … Lacks ideal strength in both upper and lower body, although he has added some muscle tone over the past year … Can score in traffic but playing through contact will be an obstacle at the college level and beyond … Definitely shows good passing ability but can put too much heat on passes at unnecessary times.

Good athleticism. Very fluid and coordinated … Runs the floor like a guard and has great mobility … Good ball handling ability, can create off the dribble … Smooth shooting stroke with proper shot rotation, good from midrange and can extend to the three point line … Shoots well off the catch as well as off the dribble. Can score off of step backs and fade aways … Can put the ball on the floor and get to the rim … Can score inside and out … Good defensive ability and versatility … Moves his feet well laterally … Goes hard for loose balls and rebounds … Solid passing ability and court vision … Hit a six inch growth spurt and is a very late bloomer … Still learning the game and has great long term potential …","Isaac still has not grown into his own body yet, and is very thin for his size at only 205 pounds … He has a lot of skill but has to rely on finesse a bit too often rather than physicality … He struggles on the interior as a 4 man due to a lack of strength and toughness, and he can be pushed out of his spots pretty easily on offense … For example, he lacks the core strength to get all the way to the rim against physical defenders and can get knocked off course, especially when he elevates … Isaac has a tendency to shy away from contact and often will not explode all the way to the rim even when he has his man beat … On the interior he struggles to hold his position when posting up and will settle for fall away jumpers rather than getting to the basket … Though he has potential on defense, he allows himself to be screened easily and lacks the physicality to fight through screens … He also lacks the strength to guard the post with consistency, which limits his ability to play the four regularly … His lack of strength also affects him on the glass, where he can get bullied often and pushed out of position … He also does not always box out and relies too much on his length to track down misses … He still needs to become a more consistent shooter to become a truly reliable threat from the outside, and he is not a great ball handler under pressure … He has a tendency to settle for tough jumpers even when he has an open lane … He does not always read and react to the defense well and can waste dribbles without covering any ground … He may be best suited as a mismatch four man at the next level rather than a pure wing player, as he has a solid handle but does not always get somewhere with the dribble … He needs to become stronger with the ball as well … Isaac has good vision with the potential to become a solid playmaker, but right now his timing and accuracy are not great, and he can put his teammates in bad spots at times … He can also improve his discipline on the defensive end … He will bite on too many fakes on the perimeter and takes poor angles on the ball … He gets lost off the ball too often and needs to do a better job of seeing his man and the ball simultaneously … Isaac has loads of talent, but he has a bad habit of disappearing for stretches, especially after a bad play or two … He can improve his ability to move on to the next play … He will need to learn to stay locked in and focused for the entire game to become more consistent and reach his full potential … While his ceiling is substantial, his readiness is not where some of his peers in this draft are at, giving him a bigger basement as well, and greater risk …Lacks much strength in both the lower and upper body … Has a slight frame. Shows long term potential to defend multiple positions but struggles keeping position defending the post, causing him to pick up fouls. Struggles with physical play … Improving his post-game would make him more dangerous around the basket especially when matched up with a smaller opponent … Can improve his left hand … May still be a year away from being ""ready"" to fully impact the college level …","Isaac is one of the most intriguing prospects in the nation.

1628374,Lauri Markkanen,2017,1,7,7,Draft,1610612750,Minnesota,Timberwolves,MIN,Arizona,College/University,1,Lauri,Markkanen,,,92,Nikola Mirotic/Ryan Anderson,"Markkanen was one of the top freshmen in college basketball last season, despite a middle of the year shooting slump, scoring 15.6 points per game on 42% shooting from beyond the arc … Markkanen’s combination of size and skill makes him one of the more intriguing prospects in the draft, and he will have the chance to develop into a valued stretch-four man in the Association … He is mature young man and appeared to be an exceptionally focused and likable teammate in his one year at Arizona … Markkanen’s upside starts with his outstanding size for an NBA power forward at 7-0 and 230 pounds … He is a fluid athlete with great coordination for his size … Most of the intrigue with him, however, is his unique offensive skillset … Markkanen is a high-IQ player that knows how to play the game very efficiently … As mentioned above, Markkanen shot 42% from distance on 5.9 attempts per 40 minutes, and he may actually be the best shooter in this draft regardless of position … He has smooth mechanics, a soft touch, and good balance off the catch … He is not only lethal off the catch, but he is also a prolific shooter on the move off of screens, pull-ups, face-up jumpers out of the post, etc … He particularly showed these abilities off earlier in the year when teammate Allonzo Trier was out for the earlier part of the season, causing him to play a lot of small forward and rely on more perimeter scoring … With more spacing at the NBA level, he will be a tremendous pick and pop threat and be able to maximize his shooting ability … Markkanen moves well without the ball when looking to spot up from the perimeter, and he knows how to find the open spot on the arc to get off a good look … His mechanics also stay consistent even when his shot is contested … He always gets his feet under him and does not waste any motion from catch to release … He runs off of screens like a guard, as he gets his feet set quickly and appears to be very comfortable rising into his shot here … In addition, he has great footwork when chased off the three-point line and can effortlessly shoot the ball off the dribble, especially going to his left … He even showed flashes of pull-up jumpers as a pick and roll ball handler in his arsenal, something extremely rare for his size … His agility for his 7-0, 238 pound frame jumps out, as he is decently effective off the bounce, which will be key for him going forward when defenders chase him off the arc … He has a pretty quick first step that is definitely good enough to get by many of the players that will be guarding him in the NBA … He is very good going to his left with the ability to put it on the floor and finish going left just as comfortably as he does with his right … Markkanen is not a high level athlete, but he can finish above the rim in space due to his superior height and decent leaping ability for his size … He also does a solid job of attacking the offensive glass for a stretch-four man … He does a great job of stepping out and hedging ball screens as well, a situation he will probably be in quite often in today’s pick and roll heavy NBA. Markkanen’s role in the NBA will be clearly defined as a stretch-four man, who can thrive in the role of instant offense off the bench or something along the lines of what Ryan Anderson brings to Houston …  Weaknesses: As skilled as Markkanen is on the offensive end, he offers nowhere near the same potential on defense … His lack of strength is a major soncern as he gets toseed around pretty easily by NCAA bigs and already has filled out with broad shoulders … His core and leg strength need a lot of work, and may never allow him to battle inside against the NBA’s top post players … He does not have great length, limiting his ability to protect the rim, and being thin for his height, he plays a lot smaller than his size … He may be more of a mismatch as a stretch-five man on offense, but the flip side is that he may not have any chance to slow down most centers on the defensive end … As mentioned, Markkanen’s lack of a strong base hinders his ability to battle for position in the post … He is also not very physical down low, and he does not have the length to contest shots from other post players to make up for his inability to fight for good position … Combine his lack of length with just average timing and instincts, and he could be a potential liability on this end of the court … On the perimeter he has good feet, but he has a tendency to bend his back instead of his knees to get down in his stance, which eliminates some lateral quickness and effectiveness … He is a nightmare to guard as a stretch-four on offense, but he often gets lost when trying to defend opposing stretch-fours on the perimeter … His intincts in defending the pick and roll and knowing when to come help from the weak side also needs to improve … His rebounding ability is also less than stellar for many of the same reasons that his defensive upside is limited … Markkanen averaged an underwhelming 9.3 rebounds per 40 minutes, as he lacks the length, range, and toughness to be a force in this department … He does not always work hard to get great position when the shot goes up, nor does he have the necessary frame to push opposing big men out of position … Scouts also question how much more there really is to his offensive game than just his shooting ability … He does not appear to have much of a post game, other than simple jump hooks and turnaround jumpers and is not a great finisher in traffic … Not the most vocal or demonstrative person, will need to work on being more assertive and vocal on the floor … He also is not a very gifted playmaker at this stage (1.2 assists per 40 minutes) and he goes left most times he puts the ball on the floor … He is much better attacking off the dribble from the catch than in isolation situations, and he does not look nearly as natural shooting the ball when going to his right hand … Aside from the defensive concerns, he also must develop his offensive repertoire outside of his jump shot.Versatile player who can play as a power forward and center… He has impressive mobility and coordination for a player his size… Possesses a nice physique and has added considerable muscle the last couple of years with no effect on his mobility … He runs the floor well and is actually really good in the open floor… Good inside-outside player who can mix it up on offense, although at the moment his face up game is a lot better than his back to the basket game… He can score in bunches and can “catch fire” at any time… He doesn’t force things on offense and lets the game come to him… He is already considered a great shooter from the perimeter, thanks to his great mechanics and NBA 3-point range… Very good in catch and shoot situations, especially from 45-degree angle… Plays Excellent the Pick and Pop as a screener, thanks to his great touch around the basket… Has improved on Pick and Roll Situations as the screener and has learned to cut faster to the basket after setting a screen… Has the ability to attack closeouts thanks to his explosive first step… Likes to finish strong at the basket and isn’t afraid of contact… Can put the ball on the floor and can even start the break or complete a coast to coast if the right opportunity comes up… He has even been used in Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler at times, with mixed results…  He gets at the free throw line at a high rate and he is a very good free throw shooter… Above average rebounder who rarely forgets to box out… Has good instincts on Defense, reads plays and as a result he makes a lot of steals… He has solid lateral quickness … Can defend the Pick and Roll at an acceptable rate when he is asked to hedge out… Knows the law of verticality and has good enough timing to make some blocks…","His wingspan is average and that limits him on both ends of the floor… He is a good but not an elite athlete… He needs time to gather before jumping and that could hurt him at the next level… He could add a little more weight to be able to stand the physicality of the next level… His back to the basket game isn’t completely there yet… He doesn’t always establish position in the post and has problems doing it against physical players… He could improve his ball handling to be more effective on Isolation situations… His shooting mechanics are excellent, but his shooting release is a little slow, which gives his opponents time to contest his shot… Consistency is an issue, since he still has the tendency to disappear for long stretches of games … At times he is a little passive on offense and doesn’t always ask for the ball… Just an average passer for now… Off ball Defense needs work, since at times he is too focused on the ball and loses sight of the player he is guarding… He must improve on Post Defense, learn how to use his body and not get bullied by physical players… Weak side defense is also an issue since at times he is just a step too slow to help… It’s really difficult to imagine him becoming an elite shot blocker due to his average wingspan and inability to jump high from a standing position … He has problems defending when he is asked to switch and has to guard an explosive perimeter player since his lateral quickness is just OK for now…",,"Rated as a five-star prospect by numerous scouting services, including ESPN, Scout and 24/7 Sports… The highest-rated European prospect of the 2016 class

State, but he is capable of creating space, surveying the floor and passing the ball with either hand out of pick and roll situations … With better talent around him in the NBA, he will look like an even better playmaker … His open court speed makes him particularly dangerous in transition, as he will collapse the defense and find cutters or open shooters on the perimeter … He does not need a screen to collapse the defense … Instead he can usually break his man down off the dribble and get in the paint to kick out to open teammates … He also shows flashes of impressive vision and accuracy off the pick and roll … He will have a chance to be an absolute force on both ends of the court in the NBA … Has excellent size at the point guard position at 6’2 with a 6’5 wingspan … Shows a lot of confidence in his abilities and has a swagger on the floor, should not have any trouble adjusting to playing at the NBA level and be a standout PG at the next level … His upside is among the best of any player in this draft …Explosive point guard with size and great intangibles for the position … Elite level athlete and plays well above the rim.

Still in the process of developing his awareness of when to turn it on as a scorer and when to distribute.

He also has good closing speed on the perimeter and can chase guards off the perimeter due to his fluidity … He also has good lateral quickness and can switch/hedge out on ball screens and still recover … He also offers upside as a rim protector with his length and solid timing once he can refine his defensive awareness … He can also use his length to get in passing lanes and force turnovers off the ball.","Wilson has some outstanding physical tools, but he still needs to learn how to maximize them with consistency … Often times instead of getting all the way to the rim and finishing with his length, he will settle for contested jumpers even when switched on a smaller player … He has a tendency to float on the perimeter when matched up with smaller players instead of posting up and using his size … He has great skill, but he will settle for a lot of contested jumpers early on in the shot clock … Wilson does not have great vision and can improve as a passer out of the post … He has a good handle for his size but will try to do too much at times and over dribble instead of relying on primary ball handlers, which leads to avoidable turnovers … Wilson needs to improve his physicality and toughness in the post, as he does not work hard to get good position against players his size … He also is not a great finisher in traffic and does not get to the free throw line that often (2.3 FTA per 40). He is skilled but he shies away from contact and mostly relies on finesse rather than physicality. He has great upside on the defensive end, but he needs to improve his awareness before he reaches that level … He can be late to hedge out on ball screens and often gets beat off the ball on cuts … He can do a better job of staying low and being in a good stance to maximize his explosiveness … He also does not always see the ball well, which makes him late to come over to the ball side and help out when needed, and he does not always jump to the ball from the weak side … The biggest thing he could improve upon, however, is his production on the glass … In 30 minutes of action last season, he averaged only 5.3 rebounds per game … With his combination of size, length, and athleticism, that number should be much higher … Improving his toughness and learning how to get good position down low will allow him to be much more of a factor here …",,"Given name is DeVante Jaylen Wilson … Born Feb. 19, 1996, in Mt.

Gets great elevation on his shot and can shoot from NBA range … Very effective in catch and shoot situations … Gets his feet set quickly and doesn’t have any wasted motion in his shot … Tremendous one foot leaper … Strong on ball defender … Very active and shows great commitment to the defensive end … Takes pride in guarding the opposing team’s best perimeter player … Very good team player … Highly unselfish, takes smart shots … Plays within the flow of the offense … Plays within himself, doesn’t force his offense or get discouraged if he’s not the one taking the shots. Buys into the game plan and understands how the game should be played … Likable personality. Enjoys being on the court with his team …","One of the biggest concerns right now for Ferguson, as mentioned earlier, is his lack of an ideal frame … He checked in at the Combine at just 184 pounds, which causes him to struggle containing bigger guards … He also can get pushed out of position pretty easily and get caught on screens … This also causes him to get pushed out of his spots on offense, as he often is not able to get all the way to the rim without an open lane … Against bigger guards and wings, he allows his man to go right through him most times without showing much resistance … He also can be too upright, which somewhat mitigates his lateral quickness and athleticism … Even though he is competitive with big men down low on switches, he is too thin to be a true threat when defending them … On offense he is easily knocked off balance when going to the basket, and he shies away from contact, limiting his size advantage … Ferguson also rarely gets to the free-throw line (2.2 FTA per 40 minutes), and he still needs to refine his in between game to become a better all-around offensive threat … His ball handling skills are very limited, and he struggles to create space, especially against better defenders … Right now he is limited to mostly catch and shoot offense and straight line drives … He also has much room for improvement as a passer and initiating offense, as he turns the ball over much more frequently than he registers assists … As common for a young player, his feel for the game and instincts on both ends are just average … He averaged just 0.4 steals and 0.7 blocks per 40 minutes, which are numbers that should probably be much higher given his tools … He tends to get lost off the ball on defense, and tends to force a lot of passes as well instead of making the simple play … As a shooter Ferguson must become more consistent … This will probably determine if he becomes a solid contributor in the NBA … With his other limitations, he must be able to knock down perimeter shots consistently … He sometimes shoots on the way down, despite his excellent elevation on his jump shot, and he is a relatively poor free throw shooter (58.3%) …Although he has incredible athleticism, he rarely shows it in a game especially in a half court set. Needs to get a lot stronger to make plays through contact … Lacks much in the way of a midrange game … Needs to improve as a ball handler and his playmaking ability … Doesn’t have much wiggle or creativity on offense … He’s a straight line driver and doesn’t break down the defense … Doesn’t have a wide variety to his scoring arsenal … Doesn’t provide much offensively if his shot isn’t falling … He plays well within the offense, but isn’t the type to put the team on his back and score in bunches in times of desperation … Can be passive at times. While the majority of the time (in high school) he’s been both the best athlete and best shooter on the floor, he doesn’t always assert himself as the best player on the floor …","YouTube sensation Terrance Ferguson is taking the step of playing professional basketball in Australia instead of playing for Arizona … Unlike Emmanuel Mudiay, Ferguson isn’t quite a surefire one and done prospect … He had a standout high school career playing for Prime Prep and Advanced Prep International, also represented Team USA as well as being a McDonald’s All American …","Measured 6′ 5.5” barefoot, 6′ 7” in shoes, 184.4 lbs, 6′ 8.75” wingspan and  8′ 7” standing reach at the 2017 NBA Draft Combine … Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Ferguson moved to Dallas, Texas as a youth and enrolled at Prime Prep Academy … He joined the school’s basketball team and played for coach Ray Forsett…ranked No. 11 overall in the Class of 2016’s ESPN 100…starter for East squad in McDonald’s All-American Game…won Ballislife All-American Game Dunk Contest…originally committed to play for Alabama, but then committed to Arizona before deciding to play for the Adelaide 36ers in Australia."

Standing 6’10.5’’ in shoes, possessing an elite 7’5.5’’ wingspan, and a 9’2.5’’ standing reach, Allen’s ability to haul in rebounds will be one of his calling cards in the NBA … Through 22 games into his college career, Allen is pulling in a very respectable 8.4 rebounds per game, which includes a 2.9 split for offensive boards … His length, really allows him to get well above the rim with minimal effort … He’s also turned up his productivity during conference play, as he adjusts further to the NCAA game … Through 8 Big 12 games, Jarrett is pulling down 11 rebounds per game, which also included 3 straight double doubles in early Jan. Allen’s length will also allow him to protect the rim at the next level … He’s not an elite shot blocker, although good (1.6 bpg), but as he adds weight and experience, he has the ability to become a deterrent in the paint in the NBA … His immense length makes up for some deficiencies moving laterally, and he’s shown the ability to hedge successfully while defending pick and roll situations … Due to Shaquille Cleare playing the center for the Longhorns, Allen has actually played this season at the 4 spot for Shaka Smart … Allen’s ability to shoot in the mid range allows this, and it’s a nice piece of his offensive game when looking towards the NBA … Jarrett has a nice touch out to 12 feet, and good hands that allow him to catch passes around the rim, and finish at a good clip (68% at the rim according to hoop-math.com) … This foundation at such a young age make it reasonable to project him as being a player in the pick and pop game, as well as a solid roll man … His FT percentage is just 60%, but again, as he’s gained confidence throughout the season, he’s seen this element of his game improve. During Big 12 play, Allen is shooting 75% on a pretty decent 4.5 attempts per game. I wouldn’t go as far to say Jarrett projects as a high level offensive talent in the NBA, but his shooting touch gives him far more potential than many bigs his size who rely on athleticism alone to get buckets … Allen is a pretty good athlete as well … He’s a fast player for being near 7 feet tall, and is already 235 pounds. He appears to have the frame to add muscle, which he will need to do going forward.6’10 center … Good size and length … Runs the floor well with good fluidity and mobility. High activity level.

Serves as an anchor and reliable paint protector. Good positioning and timing on defense … Dunks everything with authority within close … Very good rebounder … Good roll man in the pick and roll. Good hands and always alert for the pass … Appears to embrace the role of a center, doesn’t drift to the perimeter or play outside of his game … Hard working, cerebral player …  Weaknesses: Awkward free throw stance with inconsistent results. Has limited range and doesn’t have much of a face up game … Good footwork and solid foundation but lacks low post offense. Relies on putting the ball out of the defenders reach and finishing. Most of his points come from dunks and put backs. Can improve touch within close. Jump hook needs work … Has room to add strength … Still raw offensively, but shows promise …","Jarrett Allen has good end to end speed, but he’s not particularly quick laterally, and possesses a bit of an awkward gate, as he hunches over when he runs … This is not particularly a huge issue, as I feel it could be corrected and improved as he gains strength and improves his conditioning … Allen still brings the ball down too much in the lane, which can lead to being stripped, and when he executes offense in the post it is often very slow and robotic … He’s very much a work in progress on offense, and despite his size and length advantage at the NCAA level, the game still appears to be pretty fast for him, and he doesn’t handle double teams well, nor instances in which he is heavily pressured … He is a solid passer in terms of knowing where to put the ball, but he often turns the ball over when defenders dial it up a notch … He’s also not the greatest in terms of boxing out, he’s good at picking the right spot, but is often muscled out by stronger players …",Allen is a bit of a late bloomer who provides great long term potential and currently gets his worth on the defensive end.

His size allows him to see over the top of most defenders where he can utilize his passing ability and be a primary facilitator in an offense … White always plays with his head up in transition and is able to recognize passing lanes by seeing over the top of the defense with his size … He is willing passer that plays with good patience, and he does a good job of finding big men ducking in from the post area or kicking out to shooters off the drive or from the perimeter … His size, combined with good elevation also allows him to pull up in the mid range area over longer defenders … Although he is not a great athlete, his combination of size and length allows him to finish above the rim in space with ease … As a defender he is disruptive with his length, does a good job of getting in passing lanes to force turnovers, and contest shots … White’s greatest strength is most likely his versatility as a scorer … In his lone season for Colorado he averaged 22.3 points per 40 minutes on 57% shooting from two point range and 40% shooting from three, showing the ability to fill it up from all three levels … He has excellent instincts and plays with great pace and skill … White excels at scoring out of the pick and roll, where he can pull up off the dribble or finish with craftiness at the rim … He has a particularly advanced floater game, which he can use off of one foot or two feet with soft touch … White can finish with either hand and has excellent body control when going to the rim … He is also a quite capable spot up shooter, which allows him to be effective off the ball, and he can fire away coming off of screens … He does an exemplary job of getting his feet under him, having good balance, and exhibiting a quick release … White also gets to the free throw line frequently, where he converts at an excellent 81% … He does a great job of reading the defense off of the pick and roll, where he can turn the corner if the defense goes over the screen or make the defense pay with his jumper for going under … He gets great elevation on his mid range pull up jumper with crisp footwork before the shot … He also takes advantage of switches in the pick and roll by frequently using hesitation dribbles and changing direction to keep the bigger defender off balance … White attacks closeouts very well with jab steps, shot fakes, and step backs to separate into his pull up jumper … Another strong selling point of his repertoire is his advanced feel for the game on both ends of the court … He consistently stays poised under pressure and has the requisite vision to initiate the offense … He also has solid defensive instincts, anticipating plays well and forcing ball handlers to make counter moves … Out of the pick and roll, he uses the entire width of the floor and has excellent timing with his passes … He also can hit both the roll man and shooters on the perimeter from various passing angles … What really stands out in this area is the fact that he keeps his dribble alive and stays clam when the defense hedges hard on the ball screen, allowing him to continue the offensive flow … He also has good awareness defensively when locked in and understands where to be on the court at all times … His best attribute defensively is his ability to slide his feet and stay in front of a ball handler without using his hands … He does a textbook job of preventing straight line drives and forcing his man to change directions … Many scouts also believe that because White is a late bloomer, there is still plenty of room for him to continue developing … He is a Division-2 transfer from University of Colorado – Colorado Springs, and his frame may not be entirely filled out yet …","White may still have some untapped athletic potential, but at this stage he does not have great burst or shiftiness, which may limit his ability to get to the rim or stay in front of quicker guards at the NBA level … He can be too upright at times both when turning the corner on offense and when guarding his man, limiting his explosiveness … He also may struggle to get all the way to the rim and finish over the top of NBA length … He has only an average first step from a triple threat position, making it challenging for him to turn the corner easily … His lack of burst also does not allow him to play slow to fast at a high level, as he is unable to change gears with much force … Even against big men in the pick and roll, he is not always able to turn the corner and is often forced to settle for off balance jumpers … Against teams above .500, he shot 50% from two-point range compared to over 60% against teams under .500, leaving numerous questions about if he can create offense against better competition … Despite solid athleticism combine numbers, (36.5 max vert) he is generally a below the rim player in traffic, and he will have to rely on floaters mostly, but he has shown great ability in this area … White also has an easygoing demeanor on the court and can get a bit casual at times … He needs to be a bit more vocal, especially if he is going to play a lead guard role in the NBA … He also needs to cut down on the careless turnovers and play with more consistent urgency on defense … He has a tendency to telegraph simple passes, leading to several avoidable turnovers … He also will settle for too many difficult, contested pull-ups on offense at times … On defense he will take plays off; instead of getting low in his stance and being committed to stopping his man by sliding his feet he will reach a bit too often … His defensive versatility in the NBA is also a big question mark … On the one hand, he may not have the frame to guard bigger two guards and wings, but he also may not be quick enough to guard

Rabb is also a big target in the post with his long arms and great hands. He is a bit streaky but definitely capable in the mid-range game, as he utilizes both jab steps and step backs to create separation into his shot. He is crafty in the post with his footwork and is particularly light on his feet when under duress down low … Also has an underrated basketball IQ, and has good feel for recognizing double teams and knowing when to pass out of them … He also has a good understanding of defensive positioning and handled the often-difficult moments at Cal quite maturely … He has good recognition off the ball on defense and does a good job of not fouling when coming over to help from the weak side … His above average ability to close out and defend bigs on the perimeter will help him in today’s NBA …With a slight frame, for now, Rabb is very good at gaining position against defenders in the low post … At 6’10 once Rabb got near the hoop he was virtually automatic against high school competition at the rim … He has developed a consistent baby left hook shot that is his go-to move … Rabb is also very explosive laterally … Even when caught in tight spaces or too deep in the paint he possesses the athleticism to still get a good shot attempt or dunk attempt off … Doesn’t sit idle often or slough off when posting up … Mostly catches the ball and explodes right into a move … Very active on the break for a big man … Whether off a block or a rebound he will run up and down the floor until he’s blue in the face … Finishes well as a trailer and often created second chance opportunities for himself or others off a miss … Very effective rim protector … Quick to help, but doesn’t leave his feet early … Let’s the offensive player come to him before trying for a block … Uses his feet well to reposition himself for blocks … His large wingspan (7’1"") is also a big help on defense … Can pass well out of double teams and is a good overall passer … Very aware of floor spacing and where teammates and even defenders are positioned …","Rabb is more of an old school post player and does not have ideal perimeter skills that NBA teams look for in a modern NBA big man … He does not space the floor with great consistency and shoots a flat ball at times … He will need to become more of a threat off the pick and pop to be a truly reliable offensive weapon in the league, and he must continue to improve as a free throw shooter (66%) … He also does not have the ball skills to create for himself on the perimeter, and most of his scoring will come in the post … He is much better as a straight-line driver, but when the defense takes this away, he is not fluid or skilled enough to utilize a counter move and create offense for himself effectively … He also struggles to attack closeouts off the pick and pop, which really limits him offensively … Lacks the strength to finish against NBA caliber big men with better length and athleticism … His skillset projects towards him being more of a center in the NBA, but he may not have the size and strength to be effective there … He can be knocked out of position pretty easily and does not have good body control against contact … This sort of tweener identity limits his defensive potential as well, as he is a tad small for the five and not quite rangy enough for the four … He is limited as a rim protector with only 1.3 blocks per 40 minutes, and could be a liability in the pick and roll when needed to switch out against smaller players …Besides his baby hook, doesn’t have an array of post moves in his repertoire … Has mostly relied on being taller and more athletic than most of his competition … Must get stronger and fill out his frame as much as possible … Can easily be knocked off his spot in the paint … Besides rim protection he’s not really a great overall defender … Not quick laterally and often doesn’t seem to be moving fluidly when defending on the ball … Strictly a post player at this point, Rabb hasn’t adapted to the new ""position less basketball"" movement … If he’s not able to score in the post he will drift out to the perimeter, which isn’t the strongest part of his game at the moment … Really left-hand dominant, needs to put more work in on his off hand … Needs to continue to improve at the free throw line as well …",,"Born Feb. 4, 1997 … Parents are Ivan and Tami Rabb …

He doesn’t establish position in the Post and can’t really exploit any miss-matches… His Post game is just average and doesn’t have enough counter moves… At times he tries to do too much with his ball in his hands, either by forcing a difficult pass or make one more dribble than he should, which leads to turnovers… There are moments he puts his hands down when he tries to block a shot and as a result he commits bad fouls… Holds his ground in the post on Defense, but he can’t really contain strong, physical players… Can lose focus on defense, and be too concern looking at the ball…",,,"He is the son of Bruce Bolden, an American former pro basketball player, who played 17 years in National Basketball League in Australia… He lived in Australia until 2013, before moving to United States and play as a senior in two different High Schools… He commited to play for UCLA… He had to redshirt his freshman year in college (2014/15) because he was ruled ineligible… He left UCLA after his sophomore season (2015/16) and signed with FMP"

steal percentage … Willing to get low and brings a good effort in defending the perimeter … Is someone other teams need to be aware of around the basket, great at blocking shots from the weak side and was counted on as a last resort often on defense … His FT shooting went from barely above 50% to 70.5% as a junior … Has managed to cut down his fouls quite a bit, much more disciplined defender over time … While he is still not relied upon or asked to shoot much, showed a much improved touch and can hit jump shots close to the hoop … Shows solid hands on cutting to the basket with powerful

a bit, has issues when taking more than a few dribbles and can force some bad passes … Still not someone that you are confident with shooting past mid-range, seems doubtful he will ever stretch the floor much … Can at times lose focus as far as boxing out, does not always put a body on rebounders … Like most shot blockers, can also go for blocks and therefore be out of position to rebound and give up some offensive boards … Post moves can be a bit stiff and is not necessarily going to be someone you will go to on offense … Was not utilized often in the pick-and-roll, and while he has potential defending it, he still did not have a great sample size of doing so … Much better with his right hand, still struggles on the right block … His instincts as far as a roll man are still

He also has a nice array of floaters and is good at creating space between defenders in order to get attempts up over shot blockers … While not an elite athlete, he is extremely quick and has pretty good lift … A glass half full observation would mention his 6’4’’ wingspan, which is helpful considering his small stature … Evans 6.4 assists per game lead the Big 12 this past season, and he did so with a pretty solid 2.28 assist to turnover ratio … Quick hands, and good anticipation also allowed him to rack up 1.8 steals per game as a sophomore … Evans has showcased the ability to take over games … He went for 25 or more points 8 times this past season did so without sacrificing his distribution duties … Jawun can be streaky as well. When he’s rolling he proved to often be too much to handle at the college ranks, and he does enough outside of scoring he’s still a valuable asset when his shot isn’t falling …","Defensively Evans will have trouble at the next level … While 5’11.5’’ in shoes he does sport a nice wingspan, but he’s not overly strong for his size, nor is he an elite athlete … His effort is a plus, though, but he’ll be easy to shoot over in the NBA … Like many smaller guards, he also projects to struggle in the lane … According to hoop-math.com he shot just 50.4% at the rim against big men that will be much smaller and less athletic than their NBA counterparts … He didn’t enjoy the most efficient sophomore season … It should be noted that he carried a massive offensive load for the Cowboys, but 43% shooting in the NCAA isn’t a good clip, and things don’t get any easier in the NBA … A better shooting freshman season would give hope to turning things around when he’s not expected to shoot 15 times and be the primary ball handler and distributor, but he’ll also be playing against tougher competition …",,"Measured 5’11.5 (in shoes) 177 lbs, with a 6’4.5 wingspan at the 2014 Nike Guard Skills Academy"

He does an excellent job of spotting up in transition as he has a knack for finding open spaces on the court to get his shot off, where he has deep range that should translate to the NBA arc … He gets his feet set quickly as well, and his mechanics stay consistent with a hand in his face … Dorsey also does a great job of running off screens to get his shot off and looks very comfortable shooting on the move … Off the pick and roll he consistently demonstrated the ability to make defenders pay for going under the ball screen with his pull up jumper … One also has to appreciate that he never loses confidence in his shot and that he does not need much space at all to get it off … At the rim, he uses a lot of shot fakes and has excellent footwork to get his shot off, or draw contact and get to the free throw line (75% conversion rate) … It is primarily Dorsey’s shot making and ability to get hot in a hurry that gives him great potential as a role player in the NBA … With NBA spacing he could thrive as a shot maker and secondary ball handler off the bench. Dorsey is not a true floor general, but he did play a lot of point guard for Oregon, so he has experience running an offense … He is also improving as a playmaker, as he has decent vision and does not turn the ball over that frequently … He operates well out of the pick and roll and has shown flashes of making good reads to set up his teammates … Dorsey particularly showed during the NCAA Tournament that he is unusually poised in big moments and that he can be depended on to make big plays when it counts … Any potential playoff team that may draft him would really appreciate the mental aspect of his game … If Dorsey can prove that the NCAA Tournament was not a fluke and that he is really beginning to put it all together, he could carve out a nice career for himself.","The most concerning aspect of Dorsey’s game is his less than impressive physical tools for an NBA two-guard … He checked in at the NBA Combine at 6-4.5 with an even more underwhelming 6-5 wingspan … He also weighs just 183 pounds, so he may struggle to get to the rim and finish against bigger, physical guards … This will likely prevent him from being a multi-positional defender at the next level … His lack of length will limit his effectiveness to guard on the perimeter and be active in passing lanes … He has already shown limitations in this area, averaging just 1.1 steals per 40 minutes in two seasons at Oregon … With his physical profile, he is probably best suited to guard point guards, but he may not be quick enough to do so given how explosive modern-day NBA point guards are … Dorsey also does not show a great deal of competitiveness on this end of the court either … When switched onto bigger players he does not battle for position persistently … He also tends to have some frequent lapses off the ball, losing shooters on the wings or giving up easy backdoor cuts. Dorsey does not project as an advanced shot creator at the NBA level either. Given his average explosiveness and shiftiness with the ball, he can get forced into some difficult shots, and he will probably have trouble finishing around the rim against NBA length/athleticism. Much of his shot selection comes via difficult contested shots given his lack of creativity with the ball and his less than ideal physical tools. He can be out of control going to the rim as well and force a lot of wild shots at the basket instead of looking to make a play for someone else. Dorsey is not a very willing passer either, which can cause him to be inefficient at times. It appears that the majority of his NBA impact will be contingent on his shot making ability. However, if he can’t get hot from the outside, NBA teams might worry if there is anything else he can bring to the table.",,"Measured  6′ 3” barefoot, 6′ 4.5” in shoes, 182.6 lbs, 6′ 5.25” wingspan, and 8′ 3.5” standing reach at the 2017 NBA Draft Combine … Measured 6’4.25, 178 lbs, with a 6’3.5 wingspan and 8’2.75 reach at the 2014 USA U18 tryouts … Born in Pasadena, Calif. … Parents are Jerrid and Samia Dorsey … Major is business administration…2015 McDonald’s All-American and Gatorade State Player of the Year in California…Pac-12 All Freshman Team and All-Conference Tournament Team in 2015-2016 season…NCAA Midwest All-Region Team, All-Pac-12 honorable mention selection, and Pac-12 All-Tournament Team in 2016-2017 season."

After raising eyebrows as a freshman, Bryant didn’t have as spectacular of a sophomore season at Indiana. Bryant was a high-profile recruit in the class of 2015 so the talent is definitely there for a team to tap if they bring him on board.Possesses great length with a 7’5 wingspan, a 9’3.5 standing reach and solid athleticism … Competitor. Plays with great intensity, passion, and aggression … Hustles hard, runs the floor well … Great finisher around the basket … Finishes well in transition but also knows how to play in a half court setting … Great rebounder.

Isn’t the type to stand around and wait for something to happen … Good defender. Active hands. Protects the paint, blocks shots, good help defender … Isn’t afraid to bang in the paint … His intensity and desire gives him a lot of promise as these are qualities you don’t often find in a talented young bigman …","Not the most fluid or athletic player, but his great intensity helps combat this … His great length gives him shot blocking potential, however he lacks explosive leaping ability … Feet appear somewhat anchored to the floor as he isn’t good at moving laterally … Still needs to develop his low post game … While he makes a high percentage of his shots in the paint, he needs to develop his footwork and back to the basket game moving forward … He has made strides in filling out his frame over the past few years but still has room to get stronger …","Indiana landed a good one in Thomas Bryant. He does have an unorthodox playing style, one coach described as “awkward but effective”. Bryant has done a great job against players who received more praise by evaluators, often times outplaying them. After losing five top 100 players last season, he has stepped up as the leader of a very talented Huntington Prep team and should contribute as soon as he arrives on campus at Indiana.","Excelled in April when given the opportunity to play in the McDonald’s All American Game, Jordan Brand Classic, Dick’s Sporting Goods National High School Invitational, and earning MVP of the Derby Classic … Measured 6’9.5 (with shoes) 217 lbs with a 7’4 wingspan at the 2013 LeBron James Skills Academy …"

size, with some crossovers and behind the back dribbles and can even start the fast break as the ball handler … He can change speed and pace like a wing when he has the ball in his hands … He has even been used as the ball handler in Pick-n-Roll situations due to his great ball handling and passing ability … Probaly the best frontcourt passer of his generation … Has great court vision and can see angles that a few players can when he is double teamed … Can pass either on the move or while standing … Very good passer on high-low situations … Can start the break after he takes the defensive

rebounding instincts… Like on offense, he is not afraid to bang bodies in the post on Defense too… Solid shot blocker … Fills the lanes on Defense at a good rate when he is concentrated … His lateral quickness isn’t bad and has the potential to become good defender on Pick-n-Roll situations …","Very emotional player, who at time lets his emotions distract him … His attitude and body language on the court make him look a little cocky, or immature … He is just an above average athlete  … Jumps almost exclusively off two feet and needs some time to gather before he does, which will probably be a problem at the next level … Has incisostent shooting mechanics, since he changes his release point when he is closely guarded … Seems to have problems finishing in the paint against physical opponents, with the main problem being that he doesn’t always go strong to the basket and settles for floaters and finesse moves … Misses a lot of easy lay ups, which is something you don’t expect from someone with his talent … He may have the ability to become a great stretch-big in the future, but he can’t do this at a consistent level yet due to his incosistent shooting … Has to improve his free throw percentage, which for now is in the 65-72% rate … He is out of control with the ball in his hand at times, trying to do too much … Turnover prone, mainly because he either looks for the flashy move rather than just making the right play, or because he has the tendency to telegraph his passes… He loses his concentration on Defense and forgets assignments … Has problems defending the Pick-n-Roll, because he often either over commits to the ball handler or leaves after the player he is guarding sets the pick … Gets in foul trouble too often … He doesn’t have the length or the athletic ability to be considered an elite rim protector … He doesn’t know the law of verticality on defense just yet, which is something that could help him … Has a tendency to put his hands down when he tries to block a shot and he is whisted for a lot of fouls because of it … It’s questionable whether he will be able to guard athletic stretch power forwards at the next level…for as good as he is he wasn’t able to lead a good German team to the victory in last EuroU16 … It’s not a big deal but so far he looks a little more to shine for himself than helping his team winning … We are obviously talking about an elite young player, but he lacks consistency within games, where it is common place for him to do a couple of amazing plays and then disappear for a while … If he can develop the killer mentality, he should be dominant … His decision making is questionable, he doesn;t always make the best decision, but often gets away with it because he is way more athletic and stronger than everybody else, but these types of plays will not work in the future … His shot is good but needs more consistency (though he is getting a lot better as previously mentioned, and his

In space he can also finish above the rim with authority even when challenged at the basket, and he is good vertical athlete (37.5” max vertical) … His strength helps him out on defense as well; even though he lacks length, he uses his strength and physicality to compete for good position and contain the dribble … Brooks also has a versatile offensive skillset that Pac-12 teams had an extremely difficult time figuring out … He averaged 25.1 points per 40 minutes, which was good for second in the conference, and he is excellent isolation player … He can score from all three levels, via at the rim, in the mid range area, and from beyond the arc (40.4% on 4.1 attempts per game) … He is also a much improved playmaker, doing an especially solid job in drive and kick situations … Brooks is not just a ball dominant scorer though … He has shown the ability to play off the ball and space the floor due to his improved catch and shoot play and ability to spot up in transition … He does an excellent job of getting his feet set quickly and squaring his shoulders to the basket on his jumper … When chased off the line, he has an outstanding pull-up game … Brooks proved over the last two years that he was one of the best tough shot makers in college basketball … He has deep range and can bury contested shots off the dribble … He also is great at creating space via jab steps and step back jumpers.

Brooks also averaged 3.3 turnovers per 40 minutes, which is a higher number than what one would like to see from a forward … He also is not an effective rebounder at just 5.1 rebounds per 40 minutes, showing some inconsistent effort on box outs and fighting for good position … Brooks will need to show that he can bring more to the table than shot making if he wants to be a reliable rotational player in the NBA …",,"Measured 6′ 5” barefoot, 6′ 6” in shoes, 220.2 lbs, 6′ 6” wingspan, and a 8′ 4.5” standing reach at the 2017 NBA Draft Combine … Measured 6’6 (in shoes) 224 lbs, with a 6’4.5 wingspan at the 2014 LeBron James Skills Academy … Born in Missauga, Ontario, Canada…Major is general social science…Pac-12 All Freshman Team selection in 2014-15 season… Became the first player in Oregon basketball history to reach 1,000 career points as a sophomore … Was named Third-Team all-American and to All-Pac-12 first team and the Pac-12 all-tournament team in 2015-16 season… 2017 Pac-12 Player of the Year and Pac-12 All Tournament Team … Wooden Award final ballot (Top 15) …2nd Team All-American …"

He attempted just eight jump shots on the season, and looked very mechanical when doing so … There isn’t a whole lot of fluidity in his jump shot, and his 53.5% shooting from the free-throw line suggests that he does not have great upside as a stretch forward … Anigbogu is similarly unrefined in the post … Despite his size and strength, he shot just 30.4% on post-up opportunities, despite using a sizable portion of his half-court offense on the block … His lack of touch again comes into play here, but his unrefined footwork is a big factor in his ineffectiveness as well … Anigbogu can become predictable in the post, as he is limited to mostly simple jump hooks and turnarounds … His hands are not secure and he fumbles away far too many easy catches and rebounds … He also becomes very turnover prone when doubled in the post, turning the ball over on nearly 18% of his post-up possessions, which is nearly as often as the 25% at which he scores … Another issue he has is that he can be too aggressive in seeking out opportunities to block shots … Anigbogu has a tendency to find himself out of position as he chases shots he has little to no chance of getting to … While his constant motor and activity level are things to be valued, he’ll have to work on harnessing his aggression and continue to develop his overall recognition, awareness, and communication defensively in order to make the most of his physical gifts … His 7.6 fouls for per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, say a lot about his lack of defensive discipline … Even though it takes six fouls in the NBA before disqualification, he will need to improve in this area to stay on the court for longer stretches … One more area he could improve on is on the defensive glass, as he hauled in just 19.9% of the available defensive rebounds while he was on the court … His activity as a shot blocker hinders him somewhat in this regard, but his overall awareness can get better … He is capable of rebounding out of his area because of his physical tools, but he needs to do a better job of being in position to haul in defensive rebounds …",,"Measured 6′ 8.5” barefoot, 6′ 9.75” in shoes, 252.2 lbs, 7′ 6.25” wingspan and 9′ 2.5” standing reach at the 2017 NBA Draft Combine … Full name: Christopher Ike Anigbogu… Born in San Diego, Calif. … The son of Chris and Veronica Anigbogu … Has two sisters, Ada and Onyi, and one brother, Tochi … Three-year varsity player at Corona Centennial High School under head coach Josh Giles … Was rated the No. 17 player in his high school class, nationally, by Scout.com … Also was ranked No. 25 by Rivals.com and No. 60 by ESPN.com … Tabbed the No. 1 center in California and the Western region by Rivals.com … Listed as a five-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com … Averaged 17.1 points and 9.6 rebounds in 25 games as a senior (2015-16)"

Getting to the line almost 7 times per game … 10 boards per game shows his willingness to play physical and solid strength … Engaged defender who had effiecient numbers playing against bigs in the Horizon League …",,,

A calming influence , attention to detail … A plus 2 to 1 A/TO ratio at 4.7 AST to 2.2 TO … Good ball handler, capable of dribbling in traffic, breaking the press, and able to scan the floor with his handle being second nature … Has an excellent jumpshot with very good form and shooting touch … Improved upon his shooting considerably in his year off, raising his FT% to 90% and his 3P% to 37%, (from 76% and 26% as a sophomore) hitting roughly 1/3 three point attempts every game … Improvement in his shooting is a testament to his work ethic and desire … Gets good elevation on his shot, has a quick release with good mechanics and follow through … Good at pulling up and utilizes the step back jumper well to create space off the dribble … Strong family background. Father is a strong positive influence on his basketball career … Has the make up to be a quality role player in the NBA a la Matthew Dellavadova … Bigtime rebounder at 6 per game …His good size at 6’3 will give him added ability to see the floor and pass over smaller NBA PGs … Solid length with a near 6’7 wingspan … NBA readiness very good after two seasons at Washington and a redshirt transfer year before his breakout Junior year …","Most of his weaknesses stem from his lack of run/jump athleticism … Below average athlete lacking great foot speed and overall quickness … Although his size helps to make up for it, his lack of speed probably keeps him from becoming a starter at the NBA level … Lateral speed will make it tough for him to contain NBA point guards … Figures to struggle to gain separation offensively … Struggles to finish on the break due to lack of explosiveness, although is crafty at using his body to shield defenders … Lack of quality competition in WCC through much of the season could be an obstacle … Already the age of a senior and while his maturity and readiness work in his favor, lack of upside at his age (will turn 23 in September) works against him … Not a speed merchant that pushes the tempo out in the open floor …",,"Notes: Measured 6’3.5 (in shoes) 182 lbs, with a 6’6.5 wingspan at the 2012 LeBron James Skills Academy Among the finalists for Player of the Year … Considered highly likely to enter the 2017 NBA draft where he’s projected as a possible 2nd round pick … Spent two seasons at Washington under Coach Lorenzo Romar … Was arguably as integral to his team’s success (one loss at BYU) this year at Gonzaga as any player in the nation … Catalyst of Gonzaga’s run to the Title game … "

Likes coming off the flare screens and setting his both feet to square up for shot … Can make tough shoots under the pressure … Very smart when it comes to scoring in the paint, skilled and can play with his back to the basket; turnaround jump shots, spins around opponents, create space with one dribble and shooting the floater in the paint … He likes having the ball early on high post and posting up/taking his defenders on the low post and scoring … Uses lots of pump fakes to get open to create shots and scores … Does a good job at cutting into the lane quickly to the basket and finishing below the rim; can score under pressure well, and likes to take big shots … Improved his passing and he became better passer over the years … Rebounds the ball well and goes for rebounds aggressively … Hard working player … Comes from basketball family; his father played for Bulgarian national team … Has played at a high level in Europe for an umber of years now. Excellent experience … Skill set fits well in today’s NBA due to his potential as a high level shooter / stretch forward …Natural Born scorer… Good perimeter shooter, with really deep range … He is a scoring threat from everywhere on the court… A mature and polished player that plays beyond his years … Great in Catch And Shoot situations and can shoot off the dribble too … He is the ideal player to play Pick and Pop and can become a good stretch-four in the NBA … Able to go by the defenders on close outs, mainly because the defense must respect his shooting ability… Can occasionally put the ball on the floor … Moves well without the ball … Although he has strange mechanics, he has quick and high release, which makes it difficult for an opponent to block his shoot … Over time managed to become a good post player, who can turn from either shoulder to shoot … Runs the floor well … High basketball I.Q. with a great feel for the game … Very mature for his age … Better passer than most people think … Good rebounder … A hard worker … Takes and makes big shoots … Very confident player… He has shown leadership qualities…","Limited ball skills offensively for NBA. Should look to improve as a ball handler, however his ability to create off the dribble is also limited by his lack of great speed … Doesn’t possess too much of an offensive game outside of his shooting ability … Solid athlete but has to improve his body and work on his physical toughness … Defensively, Vezenkov lacks speed and lateral quickness, and likely will be a defensive liability at the 3 or 4 spots … Offensively he has trouble scoring over bigger and stronger athletes … He is not quick or explosive enough to get by forwards in Europe and will struggle to do the same in the NBA … Will turn 22 in August, so his upside is not what some other prospects available  Poor athlete by NBA standards… Not big or strong enough to play full time at the power forward position and lacks quickness and athleticism to play the small forward position … Lacks great lateral quickness … He is a liability on defense … As most left handers, he has the tendency to go left … He has to improve his ball handling, especially with his right hand … Not a good pick and roll player just yet … Has problems on the block versus long and athletic players … His limited leaping ability makes it difficult for him to finish at the rim … He hasn’t been tested at the highest level yet, since his former team (Aris) didn’t play in European Competitions … Has to put on some muscle …",,"Has Bulgarian and Cypriot citizenship, but chose to play for the Bulgarian national team … He is the son of Sasho Vezenkov, a former Bulgarian national team player, and shows the feel for the game of a guy who grew up around the game with a professional father … For three consecutive seasons (2013-2015) he was named “Greek League Best Young Player of the year” … He was named the “Greek League MVP” in 2014/15 season and he was also the Top Scorer the same year …Holds both Bulgarian and Greek citizenship"
