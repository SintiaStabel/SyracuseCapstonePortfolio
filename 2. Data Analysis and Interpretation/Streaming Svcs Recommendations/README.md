#### IST-652 Scripting for Data Science

This group project aimed at helping individuals choose the best streaming service based on their content preferences. We used data from CSV files on platforms like Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBOMax, Hulu, Netflix, and Paramount+, sourced from Kaggle. Our analysis involved statistical techniques and data visualizations, providing insights into the distribution of titles, genres, age certifications, and release years across these services.

Our project focused on identifying which streaming service offers genres aligned with potential subscribers' preferences. We developed a custom function to count genres across services, resulting in a stacked bar plot showing genre distributions. We also examined which service had the highest-rated movies and TV shows by segregating data based on primary genres and using heatmaps to depict mean IMDB scores. These analyses revealed trends like Western TV shows on HBOMax having high ratings and horror movies on Amazon Prime having low ratings.

Finally, user profiles were used to demonstrate the practical application of our analysis. For example, we recommended Amazon Prime or HBOMax for a user like Mark, who enjoys a variety of genres, and HBOMax for Jennifer, a movie enthusiast focusing on horror films.
