#### IST-707 Applied Machine Learning

This project shows the application of strategic thinking and decision-making, when we explored the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting stock prices, aiming to provide traders with valuable insights. We used stock price data from sources like Yahoo Finance and enriched it with various mathematical indicators. A significant part of the project involved using the K-means clustering algorithm for creating a diversified stock portfolio, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in categorizing stocks with similar price trends.

We evaluated different machine learning models, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, to predict Google's stock prices. Each model provided unique insights into financial forecasting, with the Random Forest model emerging as particularly effective in capturing non-linear relationships in stock data. This project underscored the importance of a strategic approach in data science and machine learning, highlighting the necessity for technical proficiency coupled with a strategic mindset for informed decision-making in data-driven fields.
