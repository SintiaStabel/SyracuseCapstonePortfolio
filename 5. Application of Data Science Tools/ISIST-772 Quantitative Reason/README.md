#### IST-772 Quantitative Reasoning for Data Science

This report provides a comprehensive platform for applying data science tools, notably R programing to analyze and interpret quantitative data. This process demonstrated my proficiency in using data science tools in various ways:

Time Series Analysis with R/Python: Using these programming languages, I analyzed U.S. vaccination rates from 1980-2017. I applied time series analysis techniques to identify trends and volatility in vaccination rates for different vaccines. This analysis showcased my ability to handle longitudinal data and draw temporal insights.
School Reporting Data Analysis: I utilized statistical tests, such as t-tests in R/Python, to discern differences in vaccination reporting rates between public and private schools. This highlighted my skill in applying statistical hypothesis testing to real-world data.
Comparative Analysis: Comparing California's vaccination rates with U.S. national rates involved using R/Python for data manipulation and visualization. This process demonstrated my capacity to perform comparative analyses across different datasets.
Correlation Analysis: I conducted correlation analysis to explore relationships between belief exemptions, up-to-date vaccination rates, and socio-economic factors. This analysis, executed in R/Python, underscored my ability to uncover and interpret complex relationships within data.
Predictive Analytics: The use of logistic and linear regression models in R/Python to predict reporting completeness and vaccination rates showcased my expertise in predictive modeling. I also employed Bayesian analysis, emphasizing my proficiency in advanced statistical techniques.
Data Visualization: I created various plots and graphs, such as scatter plots and density plots, to visually represent my findings. This highlighted my competence in translating complex data insights into understandable visual formats.

Each aspect of my work in this course illustrated the effective application of R in extracting, analyzing, and presenting data. These tools were crucial in converting raw data into meaningful insights, particularly for policy recommendations in public health. This experience not only reinforced my technical skills in data science but also highlighted the practical implications of these tools in addressing real-world issues.
